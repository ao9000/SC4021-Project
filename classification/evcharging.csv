"Kudos on your determination! That looks like a pretty complex install (I'm assuming you had an electrician do it?) and therefore probably pretty expensive.

I looked up the DCC-9-50A and it looks like its specialty is that it can be placed between the meter and the panel; it looks like it monitors the current from the meter and/or heading to the panel, and will disable the EV charger if the load gets too high (which means it doesn't affect the load rating of the panel, meter, or primary utility feed, as it only utilizes excess capacity that the panel is not using). It's good to know that such a device exists -- I have some friends and relatives that have similarly difficult environments for setting up L2 charging. The DCC-9-50A does look similar in purpose to the new Siemens device noted at https://insideevs.com/news/601056/siemens-connectder-money-saving-home-ev-charging-solution/ - did your electrician suggest this one as well as an option?

"That's pretty great. Hope it starts a trend. I'd absolutely pay $2-3 extra per day for EV long term parking that had 12 amp L1 chargers, even if I had to walk to the far end of the parking lot for that privilege of paying more. Totally worth it for a worry free trip, knowing that the car's plugged in and will be ready for me whenever I get back. Bonus that ICE vehicles would never enter the lot, so tampering would probably be less. At the far end of the parking lot, a 3 phase 150 KVA 120/208 transformer could provide a 400 amp service to a panel that could power about 80 spots, with no fancy power sharing. As it scaled up to more and more spots, and a larger and larger percentage of vehicles would spend most of their time not actually charging past for first 24-48 hours, the economics of a power sharing setup would make more and more sense. Cars would plug in, would max it out for a day or 3, then taper off. Average long term parking is 5-7 days, so long term EV L1 park-charging, on average, would only half half of it's allocated amps utilized, amp wise.

"See the missing breakers at slot 13/14? That hole should have covers on it (and no, not duct tape) per National Electric Code. Even if it was a good panel it would not pass an electrical inspection because of that. Your landlord had a city rental property inspection, not an electrical inspection. You can check with your city’s electrical inspector, just ask him if he would pass a Federal Pacific panel with Stab-Lok breakers or fail it. Your local fire inspector may also have information. You could call a Home Performance weatherization contractor and pay him to scan the electric panel with an infrared camera while all loads are turned on. If he sees any hot spots, have him snap an IR picture, turn off all the loads immediately. Share the picture with your landlord. If you share it with the electrical inspector, he’ll just kill the power and red tag the panel until it’s replaced, not a good path if you want to stay on good terms with your landlord. All that being said, if the panel was repaired with new guts or completely replaced, you then perform a load calculation per NEC. Then it would come down to the charger rating on the EV you’re looking to buy. Most that use a 120V outlet don’t draw more than 12A, some older brands only draw 6A. It’ll be slow charging, probably adding 3-8 miles of range for each hour of charging. Bottom line, don’t add any more load to this panel, not even a light bulb. It’s not a question of if it will fail, but when will it fail.",2,0.5455567,0.434762,0.019681346,negative
"Good grief people. This is a subpanel in a garage on a cinder block wall. It's surface mounted and I see 2 Romex coming out of it. So it was previously somewhere else and was recycled to be a garage subpanel. The breaker schedule is wrong and that's a code violation, that's the only reason we're confused. FPE's problems are grossly, insanely exaggerated in [pure moral panic](https://www.oxfordreference.com/display/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803100208829), as usual, driven by popular media coverage. Just like people think asbestos is plutonium because of all the lawyer ads. (which are just to find victims for an easy job cashing in on the mesothelioma trust funds). Yet people think they're going to die because of asbestos hardboard covered in 5 coats of paint. Good grie, just try to resist the urge to grind it up and huff it. So they generally have 2 problems of concern, #1 is bus stab burn-up because the unique ""Stab-Lok"" was good enough to pass UL, but has a higher-incidence of burn-ups. But here we are on a cinder block wall, I would maybe add a fireblock so in case the sheet of plywood catches, it doesn't set the ceiling on fire. Sheet of drywall for instance. And #2 is that the 2-pole breakers tend to fail to trip, because their internal common-trip mechanism will ""tram"" or wedge itself. And there's an easy answer there, for a 240V only (no neutral) load, use two singles and a handle-tie. Or a new-build breaker, which I suspect is imported from Canada, where FPE panels are accepted and supported by Schneider/Square D. I have no doubt that CSA has given these breakers careful scrutiny given the drama south of the border. So I think Original Poster is fine. I would do a hardwired wall unit with a written agreement that you take it with you when you leave.

"Federal Pacific is long out of business. I've experienced an arc flash off their older 480V 3 phase equipment and lived to tell the tale but there's a few things that I'd think about. 1. The panel is old and the parts are not made by the OEM. At 40 I'd suggest replacing any panel based on age alone. 2. 150 amps is a little undersized for service if you plan to charge an EV and the rest of your house has heavy electrical draws from heating or cooling applications. Consider a service upgrade if available and cost effective. Do a load audit and run the calculations. 3. An EV is not an intermittent current draw like your dryer, an electric furnace, stove, or water heater. It's a constant draw that can create a great deal of heat in a panel over several hours of charge time. That said you'd really want to think about how much heat you could potentially generate if the breaker is undersized, the connections in that panel are not secured, or if you get something breaker wise that sticks. Last note I'd do a hardwired charger install instead of a 14-50 plug. Plug in chargers and cheap receptacles are known to go up in smoke. I suggest a minimum of a 6/3 copper conductor with ground.

"I read this invoice as- 'Customer hired me to deliver 80 gallons of propane to their 120 gallon propane tank via the 2"" propane refilling port and expected to pay $350 for this. I instead invoiced them for delivering 400 gallons of nacho cheese spread to their flower pot via the power socket with a total bill of $5,000. They say they are unhappy with this invoice, but I'll have to investigate why.' So let's dive in... 1. There's no such thing as 350kW CHAdeMO. It literally doesn't exist. CHAdeMO maxes out at 50kW currently, there's a spec for like 150kW but nobody adopts it because nobody makes a CHAdeMO car that can handle more than 50kW and the connector has no future so nobody's developing anything for it except the CHAdeMO association. 2. The Mach.E has an 88kWh battery meaning even if you pull in with literally 0% charge and fill to 100%, you'll at most use maybe 90kWh, perhaps 100kWh if you run the AC on full blast the whole time. So it's very unlikely a Mach.E would consume 125kw in a charge session. 3. 13 min 37 sec is 0.23 hours. Even assuming you're going at the supposed connector full rate of 350 kW- 350kW times 0.23 hours is 80.5 kWh. That is the maximum amount of energy a 350kW connector can transfer in 13:37. 4. To transfer 125 kWh via a 350kW connection, assuming it's going at full rate the entire time, you'll need about 36 minutes. To transfer 125kW in 13 mins 37 sec, you will need a transfer rate of 544 kW. No charging station currently offers that, and no car on the market can accept that. 5. It says max charging speed was 161kW- multiple that by .23 and you get a maximum possible transfer of 37kWh, assuming the car stayed at the max rate of 161kW the entire time it was plugged in. In short- for multiple different reasons, this invoice is literally not physically possible.",39,0.5327096,0.44352537,0.023765018,negative

"Ontario Canada here. The average end cost including transmission and other fees, and after taxes, ends up being about 15 CDN cents per kWh. There are ways to tweak how you're charged. If you have 2 EVs, it might be advantageous to select the cheap night tariff. You'd pay something like 4 cents per kWh overnight, but the price during the day would become higher. If you charge at night, this could put you up ahead. However, I'm only granny charging a single Ioniq classic, and I've calculated that all 3 options of how electric is charged, ends up about the same. But I'm still exploring solar panels, to future proof, and to see if I could do it for fun. Instead of a roof installation, I'm considering a DIY in the yard using 2x4 cheap wood, and get a 1 to 2 kW setup going. This could in theory make driving the Ioniq nearly free. I'd also feed the power into the house and create a plug inside, because why not. People that live in areas where electricity is expensive, should absolutely look into solar panels! People in North America all too often grossly underestimate this! There is way too much negative bullshit getting parroted around among people.

"Pittsburgh, PA, metro area: a total of about $0.14/kWh for residential electricity from October to April, and about $0.19/kWh for the same from April to October. (AKA Winter electricity is cheaper than summer electricity here.) These are averages across my whole electricity bill, and would be different if I used electricity differently throughout the day than I currently do, as I am on a time-of-use pricing system. If I did the bulk of my EV charging in the afternoons, each of these figures would be probably 3 - 5 cents/kWh higher. Breaking that out, we have supply, transmission, and distribution rates which contribute to those seasonal averages. It is the distribution rate which fluctuates seasonally, causing the ~$0.05/kWh difference from winter to summer. I've been meticulously tracking the details of my electricity bill over the past 3 years and have noticed a trend whereby electricity goes up ~$0.02/kwh for a given month from one year to the next. Each contributor to my electric rate changes every now and again--sometimes going up, sometimes going down--and the net result of all changes tends to be about an annual increase of $0.02/kWh. Lastly I'll note that I have ""time of use"" pricing structure on the ""Supply"" rate. This is a program I have access to as an EV owner. 1PM - 9PM is peak, 9-11PM, as well as 6AM-1PM, is off-peak, and 11PM - 6AM is super off-peak. Both off-peak and super off-peak are cheaper than the standard Supply rate charged when you're not on a time of use pricing system, and peak is more expensive than the standard Supply rate: Peak: $0.112/kWh Standard: $0.105/kWh Off-Peak: $0.071/kWh Super Off-Peak: $0.051/kWh So, the super off-peak supply rate is just shy of half of the peak supply rate. If you add the time-of-use-dependent Supply rate to my fixed rates for Distribution and Transmission, you get the following: Total electricity rate charged during... Peak (1-9PM): $0.172/kWh Standard (non time of use pricing): $0.165/kWh Off-peak (6AM - 1PM; 9PM - 11PM): $0.131/kWh Super off-peak (11PM - 6AM): $0.111/kWh (Add about $0.05/kWh to each of those for the summer rates.)",1,0.047133937,0.8797864,0.07307974,neutral

"It really depends on how they're doing it. Since you have your own electric meter and your own deeded parking spot, I'm extremely partial to the solution where they put a feeder tap on your own electric meter and run modest sized wire from there to your parking spot. That way the EV electric cost simply shows up on your normal electric bill. This involves more wire running, but is cheaper than all the weird and ongoing costs of a separate power distribution just for the EV stations, where then they have to put metering on each station, and bill you separately. The costs on that get CRAZY out of hand. The other thing is, most people don't want to wait a year for a larger transformer. This can be solved with Load Management/EVEMS two ways. First with a master system for all EVs, so when the complex is at heavy load, all EV charging stops. Second with a system on your local apartment which SLOWS or stops EV charging when your apartment is using power heavily. So if you run a dryer load, EV charging slows from 5kW to 2kW etc. Difference being, your finger is on that control - if you want to charge at full speed, abstain from large appliance use. The last system needs significant down-factoring e.g. if your unit has a 100A panel, it may only have 45A of capacity out at the transformer, and it must be tuned down further for provisioning reasons, perhaps to 30A. But still, with your large appliances off, that's 25A or so to the car or 6kW. Anyway to your question about pricing - the shared infrastructure cost is very reasonable In My Opinion. $3k for a charging station (we're talking a Wallbox and 75 cent/foot wires added to the existing infrastructure) is highway robbery. The $1000 is a junk fee, of course. Some marketing genius, probably in the company they're working with, contrived this number as ""one EV owners are likely to pay"".

"As Robert Llewellyn (the Fully Charged podcast/Everything Electric YouTube channel) says, there's never been such a thing as range anxiety, it's always been charger anxiety. My standard ""range anxiety"" anecdote in support of this is my own childhood. I grew up in the 1970s, and my parents always had big-three sedans and station wagons; big V8s with 20 gallon tanks that got 10-12 mpg. These were gas cars with a 200-240 mile range; less than the range of my current EV. But never did my father say ""no, kids, we can't go on vacation- I'm not sure the car can make it there..."" It wasn't a problem because you couldn't swing a cat without hitting a gas station.

"It's both range AND infrastructure. The threshold of which routes are feasible is determined by the car's range, its charging technology, and layout of the charging network the car can use. My commuter car, a Ford Focus EV with 80 miles of range and max 6.6KW charging, can never do more than maybe 200 miles a day. Even that would require hours-long breaks during the trip. It would be agonizing. Going to a destination 500 miles away and returning home is never going to happen - it would take three long days each way of mostly waiting for the car to charge. Better to rent an ICE for two days. On the other end of the spectrum, a Tesla can go on a continuous road trip virtually anywhere in the US and Canada, recharging at superchargers, and any reasonable route will have a supercharger well before you run out the range you get between 10% and 80%. You can get something like 250-400 miles of charge per hour of charging, meaning that you could drive 200 miles at a time, taking a couple of 45-minute breaks and recharging overnight, and thus easily and comfortably do 600 miles a day. (I didn't believe it, but a review of the charging network on Plugshare will make this clear. I did that yesterday after arguing the point with a Tesla owner.) If your more modern non-Tesla vehicle has 200+ mile range and fast charging, you can still do road trips but you have to understand the state of the charging network between you and your destination. They're not as fast on average as a Supercharger, they're not as strategically located, and they are frequently in a nonfunctional state (like many of the Blink chargers near me.) All that to say, range IS vital to the equation, but we've passed the threshold on that - 80 miles is not enough for trips, but 250 miles is. Infrastructure is equally important; Tesla has solved this. The other providers are doing well, every year it gets better, and it's already good enough to make travel feasible. We don't need chargers every 30 miles, though that's nice and I expect it to happen.

"What the Original Poster describes as ideal does exist near me, in the province of Quebec (Canada). Practically every little village has a few DCFC, and they are plentiful along major highways. Most are 100kW or 150kW, which is not too bad considering most EVs can only draw more than that at very low SoC. And lo and behold, they are almost never down. In Quebec, the electric utility is publicly owned by the provincial government, and they also build and operate the main charging network (named Electric Circuit). They are not operated with the goal of making a profit, but rather to support the transition to EVs. The provincial government went all-in on EVs, with large incentives on vehicles, and also invested in the charging network though the public electric utility so that drivers that make the move can feel confident driving on Quebec roads. EVs now represent over 22% of new car sales in Quebec, so clearly the strategy is working. The DCFC network might become profitable down the road when a certain threshold of EVs in passed, but in the meantime it's taking a loss for the public good. In a sense, Tesla operated the same way in the early days. They took a loss on Superchargers knowing it was necessary in order to sell cars, and they probably have enough on the road using the chargers to at least break even now. That's why a this early stage, a privately-operated charging network will never meet the need in low-density areas. The timeline to profit if far too long, and there is no intangible benefit for a charging network company that does not sell cars or isn't a government pursuing a policy objective. The Ionna initiative may solve this by pooling the ressources of many manufacturers, but automakers will at least need to make a profit on the EVs themselves before they accept to take a loss on the charging network during ramp-up. Subsidies aren't always a solution, since even with the buildout subsidized, operating losses will still sink the business model.",2,0.015412107,0.45682213,0.52776575,positive

"Couple of things to consider (but not really a solution to the issue) The location of the chargers may have been chosen next to the elevator because that's the easiest way to add circuits and a conduit run to the nearest breaker panel. I would agree that chargers in undesirable parking spots tends to lessen the casual usage (and ICEing) of the spot. You mention that there are multiple companies that share the building. If this is the case, the issue may be in part that the building owner/landlord is not the same group as the tenant/your-employer. It might be worth figuring out who owns the EV charging and parking first, as that is probably the most important issue. Perhaps you might consider doing an informal survey of the parking lot a few days over a month and count the number of EVs vs ICE cars. This might be useful to share with the other tenants, e.g. 10% of the cars in the parking lot are EVs or PHEV. Tenants could push back when negotiating their next lease with additional provisions for ""5% of parking spots with 4kw charging or better."" You may also have to settle for non-dedicated EV parking spots; if the parking lot is full-ish, management won't want a lot of empty EV spots when people who aren't charging still need to park. I've seen this where there were 6 or so dedicated charging spots in the lot , later they added one charger on each of the support columns with long enough cords that could reach 4 non-dedicated parking spots. That provided some level of flexibility. You might check to see if the local utility has some rebates or programs for discounted charging that ties into time-of-use billing. Some Utilities have a glut of solar PV power early in the afternoon, and then run into a deficit early evening when everyone goes home and turns on the AC. Some utilities are experimenting with EV chargers that can be remotely deactivated by the utility when power is in high demand. People can charge at a discount rate from 9a to 3p, and then the charger may shut down depending on demand. Some utilities are providing rebates for equipment and discounted electric rates for this. If such programs are available in your area, it might offset the cost of adding additional chargers. Lastly, others have commented, having a token fee to charge would weed out some of the cars that don't really need to charge. It would still be super helpful to people who can't charge at home to get $0.10/kwh at work, but as a person who can charge at home, I would probably not bother, if the cost to charge at work and home was about the same.",4,0.21572784,0.75304735,0.031224778,neutral

"OK, it starts with your NEC Article 220 electric service load calculation. You choose different strategies depending on if you have loads of surplus capacity, versus, if you are fully subscribed from machines that are used intermittently. EV charging can squeeze into the holes left by machines used intermittently. Start by thinking about how much power your employees need. Need being different than want. Ordinarily I would just say ""give them level 1, which is 1.4 kW per station"", but in light of many being apartments, I would double that to 3 kW or even 4 kW per station. Charger drama sucks. Stations are cheap, employee bandwidth is expensive. You do not want employees taking 10 minute breaks out of their day and coordinating with other employees to move cars around, merely because there are too few stations. Let the stations do that automatically, using kit called Power Sharing. If you have 10 stations sharing 20 kW, then then with 2 cars each gets 10kW, with 3 cars each gets 6.66kW, with 4 cars each gets 5kW, 5 cars each gets 4kW, etc. And as cars finish, the power is spread among hte remaining cars. If you have loads of extra capacity, then you can simply provision power. Now I recommend using Power Sharing, as discussed, at around 2kW or 2.5 kW per car. That's because through the day, cars will be finishing, speeding up the charge of the remaining cars. As such, Power Sharing is much more powerful than you would expect. If you are fully subscribed but have intermittent loads (looking at you, air conditioner), then you can do EVEMS / Load Management. Suppose you have an A/C circuit that draws 5 kW when running. You pair that with an EV station (possibly: Power Sharing group of stations) that puts ""CT clamp meters"" on the circuit wires. When the A/C ramps up, the EV station detects that and slows down charging so the circuit is not overloaded. You can pretty much pair 1 EV station to any intermittent load like this. If you get into Power Sharing, you'll want the current setting to be higher than your 3-4 kW target, to allow for the duty cycle of the machinery. We don't currently have a good list of American EV stations that can do BOTH load management AND power sharing at the same time.

There are two dual plug options. Option 1: Power Share - meaning if one car plugged in, it can charge up to 80 AMP, but if two cars are plugged in, they split the AMP between the cars up to 40 each. So you will deliver up to 80 AMP total. Option 2: Standard power - up to 72 AMP each car separately. So you would deliver up to 144 AMP total. For your information, Teslas can charge at up to 11 kw, meaning at 240 volt they would take at most 46 AMP. Assuming Power Share is cheaper, I think it is sufficient. With an 8 hour workday, assuming 240 volt 40 AMP PowerShare per car, they would get practically a full charge during their work day without a need for Standard Power. You can set the maximum AMP lower if you don't want too much load on your electrical.

"It’s great you are looking at this incentive for staff. Do you have a budget and plan for how many you are thinking. Plan for future growth in EV adoption and maintenance with stations being out of service (sadly when a station goes down it is often not an overnight fix). If you don’t have the budget right now to install extra chargers consider having the conduit tubing for future stations being dug with this first round. I would suggest smart chargers as depending on your companies desires can set rules through the charger. Sadly EV charging is a little of the Wild West for how people utilize them, smart chargers can implement idling fees, access restriction, charges for extended use and waiting lists. Then you only have to worry about someone icing the parking spot. Consider HR policies as someone one day is going to have an issue. ChargePoint has a bunch of models likely well suited for your needs that are free standing for a parking lot. You would want to do Level 2 charging, DCFC is not cost effective especially if you will have employees parked for the whole day. While J1772 is loosing market share in the coming years to NACS(Tesla) that is still a couple years away and currently Teslas come with the J1772 adapter. Almost all cars currently on the road other than Tesla are J1772. When talking with ChargePoint see if their units will be upgradeable for NACS cables down the line for future proofing purposes or get a handful or NACS and J1772. You will know what percentage of your employee cars are currently Tesla vs other manufacturers with future state moving to more NACS. But people will likely have those cars for several more years. Does ERCOT have any programs or rebates? I would argue 32-40amps chargers would be ideal as that can help ensure full charge during a typical 8 day if you are trying to provide a perk for employees that live in apartments without alternative charging. I know more questions than answers but hopefully can help you think about what your current and future needs.",2,0.030303635,0.33069932,0.6389971,positive

"Interesting. Once Ford did it, it was only logical that GM follows suit. Right now, charging is the Achilles Heel of the American market EV. Tesla Superchargers work GREAT, just plug in and it works every time. And when they break, they get fixed right away. OTOH, EVERY non-Tesla EV is currently hamstrung by infrastructure. Try to take a non-Tesla EV on a road trip and you'll get a mess of apps to pay for charging, stations that don't charge at the rated speed or don't work at all, multiple attempts to start a charge session, etc. And when it works- each brand has their own process. It's not like a gas pump (swipe card, select grade, refuel) some you plug in then hit the app, some you hit the app then plug in, some you scan a QR code, etc. And sometimes when it doesn't work it's user error, sometimes charger error. For non-techies, this is a problem that stops mass adoption. And it's a problem that EVERY other car company is hamstrung by. If you ever go on road trips, right now a Tesla makes far more sense than any other if only because Supercharging works. **I think it's fair to call it right now- NACS probably just won the standard war.** Ford and GM will both integrate their own car app with Tesla's billing system, so those cars will be plug & charge at any Supercharger without ever making a Tesla account. Right now, nobody can beat that. Even VW/Audi, who are basically in charge of EA, can barely get plug & charge to work right. And even if that software got unfucked tomorrow, there's more Superchargers (in both sites and stalls) than every other network combined. VW would have to double or triple their investment in EA to get anywhere near the amount of infrastructure Tesla has. This is also going to mean a lot of pressure on charger manufacturers (ABB, Signet, BTC, ChargePoint, etc) to greatly reduce the complexity and cost of their hardware, increase integration (fewer Subreddit-assemblies and modules), and make the units faster to deploy with less labor. And of course unfuck their software. Because now they're competing with Tesla, whereas before they were only competing with each other.",11,0.041837323,0.26767775,0.69048494,positive

">180kw each, or 90kw if 2 cars are plugged in. Not exactly. If i recall correctly it supports charging a single EV at 200amp or two EVs each at 100amp (200a total). Watts = amps &times; volts To reach full speed (180 kW or 2x90 kW) it needs cars that charge at 900v. However most EVs charge at 400v with some high-end ones at 800v. Very few cars support 900v. That means that the actual speeds are ~80 kW for 400v EVs and ~160 kW for 800v EVs. Here is a quick table for single car charging: Car Voltage|Wattage :--|:-- 400v|80 kW 800v|160 kW 900v|180 kW Here is a table for two car charging: Car 1 Volts|Car 2 Volts|Car 1 Watts|Car 2 Watts :--|:--|:--|:-- 400v|400v|40 kW|40 kW 400v|800v|40 kW|80 kW 400v|900v|40 kW|90 kW 800v|800v|80 kW|80 kW 800v|900v|80 kW|90 kW 900v|900v|90 kW|90 kW So, unless you have a Lucid (afaik the only 900v EV) you can probably ignore those numbers.

"I honestly love it. It does so well on NEC 110.12 ""Neat and workmanlike"" that an AHJ would have to be a real \*\*\*\* to red-flag it. But I think it would be NEC compliant to pull the charge cord out of the EVSE, get the correct strain relief to go into a surface mount junction box mounted outside, and bring it into that box via a bottom port. Then run conduit from the back of that box through the wall to the EVSE, and use THHN wires to extend each of the J1772 cord wires from the outside box to the EVSE. Torque screwdriver on everything so you don't burn up a terminal. EV continuous amps are no joke. The biggest snag I see is that J1772 cords tend to be a bit fat. Walk into your ""friendly neighborhood electrical supply house""with the cord and ask them to give you a strain relief for it, but I suspect it's going to require a 1"" knockout and that'll push you into a large or oddball outside box.

"The interactive explorer is here: [https://afdc.energy.gov/stations/#/find/nearest?fuel=ELEC](https://afdc.energy.gov/stations/#/find/nearest?fuel=ELEC) This is a nice tool to have. However, I think not breaking out slow charging DCSL (50kW, 60kW, up to 149kW) creates an overly optimistic and misleading picture. The experience is very different between a 10 minute charge at a 250kW or 350kW or a 1 hour charge at a 50kW. Driving a ""fuel corridor"" with 3 stops for an hour each is exactly the bad experience that many ICE drivers fear, and different from 3 stops at 10 minutes each. It should be noted in red bold letters that the ""status"" as presented in this data set is the status for the bad experience, and as such not really documenting how far we have come. The DOE really should require and provide that information to get a better charging set that can be used by all navigation providers - charging level per post, not just the max number or a range. It also offers routes that few EVs can drive (any?) without any warning E.g. [https://afdc.energy.gov/stations/#/find/route?start=west%20yellowstone&end=fargo&fuel=ELEC&ev\_levels=dc\_fast&ev\_connectors=J1772COMBO](https://afdc.energy.gov/stations/#/find/route?start=west%20yellowstone&end=fargo&fuel=ELEC&ev_levels=dc_fast&ev_connectors=J1772COMBO) And in Bozeman, you get two options. According to PlugShare one has one 62kW, and the other has 50kW. Both are in the automotive malls outside town, so basically you have one dead hour. This is a horrible experience. We should not count this a ""success"" Looking at this data set opens the question why most manufacturers are moving to NACS. Consumers look at this data and believe they have an ideal charging experience everywhere with CCS. Then they get disappointed. The White House looks at this data set and probably thinks we are making relevant progress, but we don't. It's polluted with 50kW locations. The laggards among the OEM probably also look at this data set and think they are in good shape. But they are not.
