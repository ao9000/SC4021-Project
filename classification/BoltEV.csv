"*The shittiest of charging shitshows I've ever seen shown* was at an EVgo location in North Dallas.

"It's not the government's job to help us buy EVs. And they (EVs) are NOT as environmentally neutral as some would have you believe.

Also realize Bolts are already being sold way below the cost of manufacture. EVs in general will continue to drop in price thanks to Tesla passing on cost savings from scale of production, new manufacturing techniques and reducing manufacturing costs. Just because you get money from the Govt doesn't mean it's right even if it's right you take advantage of it while it lasts.

I’m concerned that US automakers except for Tesla will soon be between a rock and a hard place. They will still have to support ICE but also create competitive EVs at the same time. The strategy of only producing very expensive cars will fail in a few years and especially as the 18 CARB states begin sliding EV mandated quotas for new car sales starting with the 2026 model year. If the federal government repeals the tax credits it will only hasten this decline. In the meantime China is making huge strides in EVs. In my honest opinion what I think will happen is that Toyota will buy a Chinese EV manufacturer and rebrand those cars for import into the US market.,1,0.47873035,0.471262,0.050007656,negative

"Honestly, there should be no other car than a plug in hybrid. Both power plants have their down falls, environmentally and practically. Our infrastructure in no way shape or form support power consumption to that many cars. Plus what it takes to make a large battery like that you have to mine so much material, what you gained in CO2 driving it, you lost making it. I recommend you research how lithium batteries are created. On the practical side a pure electric car has allot of downfalls on its own, terrible range, cold weather kills this exponentially. Infrastructure is not set up for charging station’s and properly trained techs are not up to speed yet. It was reckless and’s irresponsible for this admin to demand all these electric car demands without having a plan to support them. Electric cars shine and out perform their ICE brothers with in town driving and’s short commutes. Now for the ICE it has its downfalls as well, maintenance cost to up keep them going, having to buy fuel and terrible in town driving and short commutes. It’s not only bad on efficiency but it’s hard on them because they don’t get up to normal temperatures with the proper amount of thermal cycles to alleviate moisture, which then causes issues with rot and drivability issues. Together though these two compliment each others downfall’s and makes a very good reliable, efficient car. That’s why I own a Volt:)",1,0.7463249,0.23366848,0.020006564,negative

Wait till you drive like 20K miles and realize the only “maintenance” has been filling the windshield washer fluid. And then you remember that you forgot to rotate the tires because you used to do that with oil changes… and your fronts are much more worn than the rears because you like that EV torque. So you rotate your tires and you realize your brakes look like new… and will probably last 100K :face_with_tears_of_joy:. It’s such a low maintenance thing.

I took a leap of faith because “It’s not a Chevy, it’s an LG battery on wheels” 2) GM brings the Bolt to market. I think, how cool! GM is trying. I won’t buy one, but neat. I get a job 2 miles from home. What do I need? I need an EV. Two miles to work will kill my ICE truck that is 20 years old. By now the Bolt has been on the market for 3 years. I heard about the fires, but was promised I am safe because these batteries were made in Michigan. It’s really a battery on wheels GM’s past be damned. 3) The utter and complete disregard for the consumer. Guess what I have not one, but two level 2 charging stations. (I know I am spoiled, 1 is a detached garage). Neither of these will work outside. The cable doesn’t reach that far! 4) The 20 year old truck I dispensed of and replaced with the Bolt HAD NOTHING WRONG WITH IT. It was a Toyota’s second year of production for the first gen Tundra.

"I'm not surprised they've killed the Bolt. It was always going to be a ""limited run"" because GM has clearly shown that the ""Ultium"" platform was the way forward with their BEVs years ago. Now that the Ultium platform vehicles are rolling out, there's no need to keep on manufacturing the Bolt. Also Bolts are manufactured in the US, that's EXPENSIVE compared to its replacement, the Equinox EV, which is manufactured in Mexico. Also, there's not a large market in the US for small hatchbacks and add to that the fact that average consumers also expect small cars to cost a lot less than larger cars (eventhough in real life, the labor involved with manufacturing one is about the same and the difference in material costs for an extra 12"" of car is only a few hundred dollars at most) manufacturers that have to show their stockholders the largest ""profit margin per vehicle"" possible so their stock doesn't tank, don't like making low margin vehicles. I'm more surprised that they killed the Volt since there's no replacement in GM's line up and there obviously is a lot of consumer demand for plug in hybrids going by how many other manufacturers have hybridized their ICEV line up.

"The Volt/Bolt was a testbed/prototype for the upcoming BlazEr/Equinox/TahoE EV SUV products. They never wanted the Bolt to be a long-term product. Ford proved that the ""no more sedans/coupes/hatches"" is a viable strategy and most of the market is going that way. My guesses: First, Chevy wasn't going gangbusters with the gen1 Bolt because they didn't yet have the production or market for it yet. Parts like e-motors and battery trays require new production and inspection equipment. I know because I sell some of that equipment, and this is all new to manufacturers. Then, as Chevy got good at producing EV drivetrains and battery units, they updated, advertised, and sold the shit out of Bolts. They cannot keep up with orders right now. The fact that people are struggling to acquire one is great news for them but it's not like they're holding back. Production is capped because of equipment. Finally, they never wanted to continue building sedans/hatchbacks. They stopped years ago with the exceptions of EVs/PEVs and the Corvette/Camaro. So when they could, they cancelled the Bolt as soon as they could transition to producing the BlazEr/Equinox/TahoE they always wanted to. The Bolt proved they could build large numbers of EVs and battery/drivetrain technology could handle SUV duty. I hate all of this too sinceI generally don't like SUVs. Like it or not the market (not just Ford and Chevy) is and was going that way anyway. It's going to get worse too, since Chevy has already announced that the C8 Vette will be the last gas Vette and they also said they're going to pimp out the nameplate for VetteSUV's and other shit too (like Ford did with the Mustang Mach-E). Anyway, as a Bolt owner, this is likely good news for resale values at least through 2026 or so.",1,0.2955595,0.649025,0.05541552,neutral

"Tint all the windows! Not only does it make the car look better, but I've found that it really helps keep the cabin more comfortable. That's really true of most any car, but the extra help is useful with an EV. In SoCal, I'm averaging about 11% HV battery consumption to climate control. It would be even higher without the tint; since having mine installed, I'm finding that I'm just as comfortable with the AC on auto at anywhere from 2-5°F higher than in my Tahoe. Sport Mode is fun. Especially to turn on while accelerating onto the freeway :) I don't have Super Cruise, but ACC is amazing on freeways, especially in heavy traffic. It's also quite smart about using regenerative braking, as is at least as efficient as I am on manual. One pedal driving is similarly amazing, but only in town (and other stop-and-go situations--not freeway-style slow-and-go). Works exactly like compression braking on a manual transmission. Paired with the regen-on-demand paddle, you don't ever need the brake pedal after a bit of practice.

"ABC. Always be charging. So when you get home just make it a habit to plug in. That way you always have a ""full tank"". Sign up for two or three of the charging networks in your area and keep your credit card on file with each of them. Using an app to control charging sessions is the easiest way to manage them. You also may want to watch some YouTube videos on how to use the high speed chargers with your EV. Unlike with gas pumps, you normally plug the cable into the car first before authorizing the charging session. The car and the charger will ""talk"" to each other while you are authorizing the charging session. Download both Plugshare and ABetterRoutePlanner (ABRP) onto your phone. Plugshare is crowdsourced information on chargers with pictures, reviews and ratings. They often have nearly realtime info on whether the stations are operational or not. ABRP is excellent for planning longer trips that automatically route you with charging stops. Lastly, cold weather and wind can dramatically screw with your range. Always have backup charging stops in mind when you are driving in the winter. RV parks are a good emergency backup but you'll need a TT30 (120v, 30 amp) and a Nema 14-50 (240v 50 amps) to get a faster charge. Also call ahead. Some RV parks are reluctant to allow EVs to charge as they stress their electrical systems. Enjoy your new EV!",27,0.010741634,0.62325895,0.36599943,neutral

But, if you don't use it much (due to Covid) and therefore do not need to charge it more than once during the week, am I being foolish in thinking that if I recharge it outside and keep it at 85% (lowest level to get the automatic diagnosis during 4h) that if I wait for 24h after the *charging* is completed, it will be safe (enough) to bring it back in the garage until the next time I drive it more than 10km and need recharging? Is the rule above meant to say ""never park it inside, under any circumstance except for charging if you have no choice"" or ""take it outside immediately after charging if you must charge it inside"".

So I unplugged him and put it on my egolf.. Turns out the guy was in the car.. I plugged in. He got out and just gestured with his arms down and palms forward.. Like what the heck.. so I said I just need a little charge to get home.. In thirty miles from home and only have twenty on the dash.. Then I asked him how much charge he had and he said ten. So I have it back and apologized. If I had a bolt I wouldn't have ran out of range.. Anyway it was his fellow Tesla owners that made me think he was just another hogger. Also my phone data wasn't working so it was going to be harder to find a charger.. about five min later while I was trying to look up a new charger the other spot with a Tesla in the free volta j1772 charger also became free.

First, my teenage son has a habit of sitting in the car while parked in the garage after baseball practice to listen to music and decompress with his seatbelt off. The Volt captures time while in park without the seat belt engaged as time the driving time without a seatbelt. I conducted an experiment this morning to validate this, and it’s true. For much of his driving, it’s showing him wearing his seatbelt \~50% of the time which is a complete mischaracterization of his driving behavior. Second, the time stamp is off by 7 hours which could result in evening driving trips being registered as late night (12a - 4a) driving. Last, I took a spin in the Volt this morning to test the hard acceleration. What the Volt deems to be hard acceleration is ridiculous. The Volt registered 4 events of hard acceleration for a cruise around my neighborhood with the accelerater depressed no more than half way and what I would characterize as moderate acceleration at best.

"You might already be aware of this, but in case you're not, with reference to your point number 7: EV batteries have a charge curve based on their current state of charge. The closer it is to full, the slower it is able to accept additional charge. When you use a route planner, it will usually try to get you as close to minimum SoC as it can when picking the next charging station, and then have you move on before you get to full charge, because you can go from 10% to 60% a lot faster than you can go from 40% to 90%. If some of your stops were just to top off, you might already have had a high enough SoC that you were down the charge curve to 38-42 kW. By the way, you are a braver Bolt owner than I am. We did a road trip to Cape Cod a few years back and regretted it because of the charging situation. Turned a 9 hour trip into closer to 12.

"We've just hit 150,000 miles in our 2019 Bolt EV that we've owned just shy of 4.5 years. Luckily, we've never had any major issues with it (knock on wood) other than the battery recall. We're mid-way through our third set of tires -- Michelin CrossClimate 2 (highly recommended). We are on our second windshield -- a rock jumped up and cracked it fairly early in its life. The only minor issue that we've had is that the BSM LED on our driver-side mirror has been out for quite some time. I asked about getting it replaced when I went in for the battery swap, and they said it would be about $300 and they would call me when the part comes in. I ""tested"" it once, and the car beeped and counter-steered -- so the sensors work fine. The dealership never called me back about the mirror. My two cents... avoid Sport Chevrolet in Silver Spring, MD -- they also had me waiting two hours for a loaner car because they weren't paying their Enterprise Rent-A-Car bills and I arrived on the morning that Enterprise decided to cut them off. Enterprise called me and apprised me of the situation. I had to go to the service manager and tell them to pay their friggen bills. That left me waiting about two hours for office workers to arrive so they could slap new plates on a car to make it a loaner, and that made me late for work. We're about to move close to where we need to be, so, we're near the end of driving about 4,000 miles per month. It'll be a few years before we're reporting back for 200,000. I do have a question... 150,000 miles is when you're supposed to get a coolant flush. But If i recall correctly, 2 of the 3 coolant lines were flushed when the battery was replaced at about 88,000 miles. Does anybody know which line I should ask to have flushed? I know the EV tech will know, but the intake folks will have no idea what I'm talking about so I want to be specific in my request.",32,0.028733382,0.26140836,0.70985824,positive

"If it was me, I would start a buy back look to see if you could put a equinox on order. Faster charging (looks like 90kw or more) and newer platform.

On my buy back, they said once my buy back was started I could get the vehicle fixed and they would still finish the buy back ymmv. They did take away the loaner after I refused their ""fixed"" but the ev conicaige still covered fuel cost even past that. They do take a long time to send a cheque for fuel reimbursement.

"My concern is whether or not the battery conditioning system was working properly on your vehicle. The Bolts are liquid cooled, which is superior in reliability, if it is working properly. If there was a programming update your dealer failed to install in a timely fashion or prior to delivery, that may affect the response of the vehicle itself and give this type of warning because the “condition of the battery” could not be optimally maintained and therefore tripped the warning message. Car gets towed, dealer gets it and determines “OOPS” we forgot to optimize and properly prep the vehicle for delivery, now what we gonna do? Oh, umm, well guess we HAVE to give them a new battery to be on the safe side. Do you see where I am going with this? I bought from a dealer, two of these. One in September (currently 25,000 miles) and one beginning of April (around 541 miles) both running fine. But these are not on the lot 2 hours and they are SOLD! If they happen to get one that is not consumer order, and yet each time we purchased we were told have to have a day or two to PREP vehicle. Part of that prep is doing the updates in the EV software, and this includes how the Battery conditioning works. So I just wonder :thinking_face: could your situation have been the result of good old fashion “human error”?",2,0.5010482,0.4592782,0.03967353,negative

"I'm glad to see this thread. I've recently been looking into getting an EV and charging speed has been one of the big points in which ones I'm considering. Hopefully people here can help since I have some questions. I've been mostly looking at a Bolt or Kia EV6. My electric car experience is limited, but a few years ago a friend borrowed a Tesla and we took our families from central California, where we live, to the Grand Canyon and Vegas. Pretty long trip and at that time there weren't nearly as many charging stations as I see today. Anyway, if I got an EV, a vast majority of the time it would be around town driving and charging at home. Actually, my wife would be the one driving it since I usually bike to work. About once a month though we go to LA or SF which is about 200-250 miles, we live right smack in the middle of California. Some of those miles to the cities are going to be in the mountains too. I'm curious how long it would take to charge and how many stops we would have to make in the Bolt vs the Kia. I've read a lot of people talking about the Bolt being slow at fast charging and the Kia/Hyundai being very fast but honestly, how much of a difference is it? I prefer smaller cars, and I like the way the Bolt looks and it's like 15k cheaper and they give you the L2 charger for your house. These are all big plusses in my book. My wife, however, likes nicer things and the Kia is bigger with the better interior quality it seems. Personally, in everything but claimed charging speed, I prefer the Bolt but we haven't actually been in either. I can't exactly go test drive these cars since none exist around here and everyone I know who has an EV drives a Tesla and their charging situation is it's own thing so they can't really help, they just say buy a Tesla, which I'm not interested in doing. It would be a hard sell to my wife if every time we visit family or go to Disneyland or something we're at a charging station for an hour while other cars come and go or if the difference is really that big.

"I'm by no means an expert but the DC fast charge rate is most likely determined by the cells in the battery pack. But that maximum rate is hard on the cells. So they probably limit it further to meet their battery pack longevity, mtbf and warranty goals. The expense would come in cells that can handle the high charge rate. The rest is just heavier wiring and larger power relays. The heavy lifting is done by the fast charger. The car requests what it needs and the voltage is regulated by the charger such that that battery charges at whatever current is required. As it charges the car requests the charger to supply a lower voltage and current. Essentially, the charger is a 20 or 50 or 100kw or whatever programmable hv power supply that can typically supply up to 800v or so, controlled by a controller that can speak the right protocol to talk to the charging vehicle.

"This summer was a wild ride for my Bolt EV. It's my 2nd year autocrossing with it, and 1st year entering it into the STH class, a subclass of ""Class 3"" in the SCCNH series. At the first weekend of the season, I didn't have my coilovers, so the only mods to the car were the wheels + tires, rear sway bar, and brake pads + fluid. Still, managed to finish 4th and 3rd that weekend, not bad! The second weekend of the season I managed to have my coilovers installed, and that made a huge difference! The car really picked up a bit of pace, especially through slaloms. No understeer either, if anything the car oversteers a bit. Picked up 2nd on Saturday, and 1st on Sunday! Hence the gold medal in the last photo! Needless to say, I was thrilled. The final weekend of the series I managed to get the car dialed in quite well, but faced some of the stiffest competition all year, a 370Z and a BRZ were both in contention of taking the win, the points were so close. I ended up taking 3rd and 2nd, enough to tie me with the BRZ for the season, and just eek ahead of the 370Z! What a thrilling result this season.

"Paint guy here. A wild color like that is actually very difficult to achieve and involves more expensive paint. So to a degree, it is subsidized. Scientists, fighting some racist ideas, were looking for why some children had developmental issues, and they found cheap paint with white lead pigment. Tragically, titanium dioxide white was also cheap, so that was utterly needless. But the result was, lead and other heavy metal based mineral pigments were banned from non-artist paints. And this took out all the wonderful, cheap, durable, bold color pigments based on lead and chromium. What's left in bright colors? Organic pigments - which are either very costly, or, cheap and quickly degrade in sunlight (random rattle-can spray paint, this is why your OSHA Yellow Krylon spray can turns into OSHA Beige. I normally pay $160/gal for my black and white very high quality marine paint, but when I tried buying burgundy it was $340. For the pigments. So the safe, cheap, stable mineral pigments are down to carbon black, or titanium white, and most other pigments are organic. Now gaze across any random parking lot and what do you see? Fifty shades of gray. Now you know why. Automakers don't want 5-year-old cars looking rough, so they generally dig deep in their pockets and use the best organic pigments, just like my marine paint supplier. All that to say, that is one costly deluxe paint job, so appreciate it!",2,0.6545315,0.32108632,0.024382195,negative

"I feel for you, your wife and your Bolt. My prayers are that she gets the proper medical care and heals fast. I had a similar situation in April 2023. My 2017 Bolt was rear ended by Speed Racer driving a Jetta at 70MPH. I was stopped waiting to make a right turn. He was attemptig to pass a slower moving vehicle in the center of three lanes by passing on the inside. He didn't look and I was there. My Bolt did a 180 and the rear was more or less all over the road. My recommendation is to really dig into the valuation that the third-party adjuster will make. Look at every line and every feature on every comp. Don't let them get away with saing that your Bolt was in fair or good condition. Mine was in excelltnt and I had interior and exterior pictures to prove it. Take them. Many mistakes were initially made in every feature that my Bolt had (Premium fully loaded) vs comparable vehcicles. I had to argue for every one and correct mistakes. Don't accept the first version of the report. Keep pushing and get your insurance company involved. They will assist you. Be sure to get credit for sales tax, tire condition, unexpired registration and anything else. It all adds up to your vehicle value at the time of the collision. Look into your insurance policy if there is any risk of under insurance in the at fault party. My insurance had to initially cover the loss and then seek subogration against the other party insurance. I found out that my policy had a 20% bonus to the settled value for a totaled vehicle. The at fault insurance company would have never had that. You are going to get screwed by the recent decline in selling price. With all of the used Bolts on the marked from GM buybacks and Hertz dumping their inventory, the price has plumeted. In April 2023 the price was much higher. I ended up settling for just about my initial 2017 purchase price net of federal tax credit and state rebate. This covered the purchase of our 2023 EUV Premier net of federal tax credit and state rebate. Good luck. If you want to send me a message, I will be happy to have a conversation. I didn't go with an attorney and represented myself. You should seek counsel and make a decision.

Question for ex-Volt to Bolt owners: Do you find the Bolt/EUV is just as efficient as a Volt? I have a Volt now and almost always exceed the EPA numbers by a wide margin. Especially in warmer weather I am used to getting 4.5+ mi/kWh and range will meet or exceed 65-70 mi vs the estimated 53. I hypermile a lot and rarely drive my car like a race car Laugh out loud..
