I made some recent mistakes.

Mistake 1: I bought the enhanced autopilot for $6000 on my new Model Y.

If you are going to get a Tesla, don't buy it. Just don't. At the very least, you can rent it on a monthly subscription that you can cancel anytime. The only thing it does over the standard autopilot is it has this click to change lane feature. Neat, but not worth $6000. No, there is no auto-park, with it anymore. Nor is there a summons feature anymore. Maybe they will come back. Maybe they will not.

Also Tesla, if someone pays an extra $6000 for an enhanced autopilot, how about one that DOESN'T ACTIVATE THE FUCKING WIPERS EVERY TIME. In autopilot, Tesla requires that the wipers be in auto. Of course, on a clear, dry windshield, auto should be equivalent to off. Sadly, that doesn't seem to be the case on mine. I called support and they simply said ""this is a known issue. There is no ETA for a fix."" No refunds allowed on the autopilot.

Mistake 2: I bought a Tesla. Don't get me wrong, there are a number of things I love about the car. But, combines with the wiper issue, and the fact that occasionally (and I mean at least every other day on my work commute) the car chooses to drastically decelerate when on autopilot. That's just downright dangerous.

I had some minor gripes about some other things they told me would be included but are not.

But I still wanted some sort of venue to air my grievances and suggest that maybe people who want a smart electric vehicle shouldn't pay to become Tesla beta-testers.

I wish I had waited to test drive an Ariya or something like that. My 5 year old Nissan's auto pilot was better than the Tesla's is right now.

Follow up: based on comments from another posting, comments which at *least* gave advice beyond ""wait for a software bug fix"" that Tesla gave me, the problem still exists.  Also, someone (or some bot) downvoted it, well, from 10 to 0.  I don't care about karma, but I do want exposure on this.  I find interesting that either a bot sought out such a post to downvote it, or there are just some Tesla fans that are unwilling to acknowledge the faults in the product (that may or may not exist for you) and the total apathy and lack of support from Tesla.

anyway there's a new tesla owner with paper tags who seems to be leaving his car there randomly all day and or  night..

There's 2 chargers at the location.. and about 10 of us who share.. but now we sometimes we're sharign one because of him..  which means often no charger is available.

I mean i know sometimes we can't make it back in time to pick up our cars..or just forget because life can be destracting but this guy seems to be doing it on a regular basis..

I don't want to call and complain because I hear Volta won't do anything and the stores won't do anything and i dont want them cracking down hard on everyone anyway..

So i'll just continue to monitor the situation..   Just thought i'd post and see what your comments would be..",None,None,Charger hogger,0.87,https://www.reddit.com/r/electriccars/comments/18ufrrp/charger_hogger/

My husband and I found a deal on a Polestar 2 2022 with 101K miles on it. Are there any worrying consequences on an electric car that has been driven 50K+ miles per year? How would it affect battery life and are there any other issues we should be aware of?
