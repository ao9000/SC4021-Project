Now thankfully I was following with quite a distance between so I had time to react. However if I was much closer it could have been a different story. Braking without lights is dangerous and annoying and I wish manufacturers can do something about it.

One out of every five cars sold in California is now powered by a battery, registration data released Wednesday by the California New Car Dealers Association shows.

In the first nine months of 2023, electric vehicles accounted for 21.5% of cars sold in California, a figure that’s more than doubled in the past two years. When combined with hybrid, plug-in hybrid and fuel-cell vehicles, the year-to-date figure is 35.4%.

California has long been a champion of electric cars, and Governor Gavin Newsom said he’ll phase out sales of new, gasoline-powered cars by 2035 as part of the state’s fight against climate change.

Personally, I can't wait for a small, reasonably affordable rear wheel drive coupe. Something that would compete with the Alpine A110, Cayman or M2.

The low weight distribution and instant torque would make a small RWD coupe an absolute riot IMHO.

Anyone else had a similar thought?

I wonder what manufacturer will be the first to do this? How much would it weigh and what kind of pricing would we be looking at?
