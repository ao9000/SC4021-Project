This is a follow-up on the battery upgrade post I made a while back, [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/BMWi3/comments/llbl04/i3_hv_battery_upgrade/).

It looks like we are ditching the multiple options and just sticking with one single pack for the i3 going forward.

It will initially provide \~200 miles (322 km) of highway driving range in most conditions with the initial usable capacity of about 48kWh\*. We may unlock more range later on if conditions allow.

It will use an improved liquid thermal management system that operates alongside the current phase-change cooling and resistive heating solution.

The mass should be very similar to the current 120Ah i3.

120kW DC fast charging support!

Cost: \~$8k USD. You may trade in your old battery pack to bring down your investment cost significantly. 10-year warranty.

\-----------------

The issues we face currently:

We need our cell manufacturing to be operational to make these packs at these costs. Meaning that they may be delayed until 2023-2024. We can provide them sooner but at a significantly higher cost.

We are not planning to offer installation in multiple locations. Just at our factory in Maryland, USA. We are depending on automotive shops or upcoming EV shops for installation.

\-----------------

Lastly, we are hiring!

Consider joining us if you want to work on everything energy related.

Get in contact with me here, positions will be available soon for both Maryland and remote.

\-----------------

There are extra stuff there that are not included in Connected Drive.

Now to come up with an open source package to deal with this 3G sunset that doesn't cost $1400.

It should be a DIY thing and/or a low cost module.

I bought her from BMW as an ex demonstrator and had every extra even the useless sun roof and traffic jam assist but also the great heat pump which kept my range in winter.  

In 100,000kms of driving servicing costs have been under ‚Ç¨1000 for 2 sets of tyres and front brake rotors. The battery still shows the same capacity from the day I picked up and it still feels like driving a go cart. I am really sad to see it go, I am mad that I cannot keep her as they will surely be a future classic as they still look fresh today as they did when launched 10 years ago and who can pass up a carbon fibre tub and aluminium chassis but I need the trade in for my next car. 

I looked and test drove the next generation of electric BMW‚Äôs, but I feel BMW has lost the plot and gone backwards with their design.

I received the email from ConnectedDrive services stating as much and I'd get free services until the end date, even though I had already renewed service until Nov 2021, so 3 months free. Some laughed it off and have let their subscriptions lapse long ago. I for one like the ability to set the car to cool before I get to the door, and real time traffic is very useful to avoid jams along my routes.

I read posts of the 4G TCU part number that directly replaces the 3G TCU, posts of other BMW model owners talking about the upgrade and a single post of an i3 owner that got their broken 3G TCU replaced with a 4G one under warranty. I decided to get my 3G TCU replaced when I brought my i3 in for HV battery warranty test (see other post). All out of pocket.

I gave the service rep the 4G TCU part number (84-10-6-836-777) to order because I was not sure they would install if I bought it outside of their supply chain, and put  the work order to replace the 3G one and program its replacement. At first they sound unsure that this could be done but I replied that the only thing needed to be done is to program with ISTA+, which I don't have access to and no expertise to use it. Maybe contact ConnectedDrive in addition.

So when I went to take back the car to await the arrival of the replacement battery modules they've already replaced the TCU, and I successfully activated cooling as I walked to the car. They gave me the 3G TCU as a keepsake, and I managed to query the tech that performed the upgrade. Sure enough, the only thing they had to do is program the TCU using ISTA+. Looks like it is a drop in replacement.

I still need to contact ConnectedDrive to make sure they don't deactivate my VIN when Feb 2022 rolls around but it has been working fine for about a month now. All it cost is \~$1400 parts and labor. I'm sure if you order the TCU online and/or have access to ISTA+ the costs would be lower than having the dealership do everything but this proves:

**TL;DR:**

BMW is full of it when they tell you that there is no way to upgrade your TCU. They just don't want to put up any money even for a discount.

Here are pics of the work order, plus old and new module and its connectors.[https://imgur.com/a/YOFzFSh](https://imgur.com/a/YOFzFSh)
