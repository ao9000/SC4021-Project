"I support EV as a car guy but the out right hand on new ICE cars by 2035 is a bit aggressive. 

There’s quite a bit of things we need to solve before a out right ban is accessible for the mass public. As of right now, most people can’t own an EV because of no charging stations if you live in an apartment complex, condo or in-law (unless an expensive unit that has charging stations but that’s limited spots). 

Then you have to solve charging speed. 30 minutes plus to charge to 80% from like 30% isn’t good enough. I have been to charging stations where there is a 10 car line waiting for a charger and the wait is long as f.

I feel like once we solve these things or if by 2035, it’s solved then we good. But I personally think it could be solved by 2035 but we won’t have the infrastructure available for it by 2035.

<p>There’s quite a bit of things we need to solve before a out right ban is accessible for the mass public. As of right now, most people can’t own an EV because of no charging stations if you live in an apartment complex, condo or in-law (unless an expensive unit that has charging stations but that’s limited spots). </p>

<p>Then you have to solve charging speed. 30 minutes plus to charge to 80% from like 30% isn’t good enough. I have been to charging stations where there is a 10 car line waiting for a charger and the wait is long as f.</p>

<p>I feel like once we solve these things or if by 2035, it’s solved then we good. But I personally think it could be solved by 2035 but we won’t have the infrastructure available for it by 2035.

Now sure how low-income rural / urban folks will be able to afford cars (including charging and upkeep) anymore if this happens.  There are no EVs yet made for them and I can't see it happening.  I believe the Leaf is being discontinued which leaves a Mini as the least expensive at around $30K.  So they'll be driving worse and worse ICE beaters until maybe some of them can afford a used EV.  But a used EV may not be the best choice of vehicle.  Also the least  expensive EV's are very small cars which do not work for everyone.,"<div class=""md""><p>Now sure how low-income rural / urban folks will be able to afford cars (including charging and upkeep) anymore if this happens.

"I certainly have insights into this. 

I'm 37 now and am incredibly grateful daily that I didn't have social media in my teenage years or even have it in the same degree that it exists todays in my 20s. I've struggled with insecurities and figuring out what happiness is when younger and while I am far from having everything figured out I've come a long way since then.

I always had very realistic expectations of what having my dream car(s) would be like, something 13 year old me would be proud of and for close to a year nearly no one, even in my closest circles knew about my supercar  purchase and that was key to it all. Even today my IG is filled mainly with dog pictures and not one of my car.

I can guarantee you, after talking to tons of ""successful"" people, they are all as insecure about themselves as anyone. Anyone that **constantly** posts about their workout routines, car photos, first class flights, etc. **do it solely for validation from others**, otherwise why post it at all? 

If you've noticed, the most attractive men/women on IG will constantly post hot photos of themselves and get comments from their friends (and strangers) along the lines of ""omg so hot"", which fuels them--and there's an unwritten agreement that the poster of the photos will do the same to their friends, creating an endless cycle of validation to each other.

I live life now in a very good place, due to being realistic of what does make me happy. Seeking validation from others is like any other drug, there's a temporary high, but once it wears out you just need more of it just to get back to your baseline--and that's simply unsustainable.","<div class=""md""><p>I certainly have insights into this. </p>

"I love everything about this video. 

I bought a Z06 awhile ago and at the time I didn’t realize why I really wanted it. I wanted it so people would accept me for what I drove. I was tired of being made fun of for driving an RX8. I was tired of being the “slow” friend so I bought the fastest car I could for the money.

That car didn’t bring me more friends. It was way less reliable than my RX8 and I could hardly drive it anywhere without it breaking. It was a nightmare. I lost three years of being in the car scene.

All those people with “slow” cars were still out there. Driving them, hanging out, enjoying their time, but they never invited me because my car was broken.

I wasn’t happy and staring at that yellow lemon in my garage just made it hurt. That car helped me grow. It doesn’t matter how much hp you have, no matter how usable or unusable it is. It doesn’t matter how cool your car looks or sounds. Cars won’t make you happy until you’re satisfied with what you have and you’re satisfied with yourself.

"They touched on something in the beginning that I think is also really important to talk about. The ""oh I'll finally be happy when I can get X."" I know I've been guilty of it, believing ""things are going to be so much better when I get my degree and can finally do things I've put off to be able to get my degree,"" and I know a lot of people on here are guilty of it. 

And it may be true, things might definitely be better when you attain something or build up a part of your life! But I think that mindset also inherently obscures the present in a way. I've been thinking about that a lot now that I can no longer go to classes with the pandemic. I didn't realize how much I enjoyed going to classes and being on campus, and hanging out nowhere with my friends because we have no money to do things *because* I was too focused on the next step, because I was too focused on what we *can't* do due to lack of money, rather than what we *were* doing. Talking to a lot of people, they feel the same way. 

It's great to have goals and dreams and want things, but defining your happiness as attaining said things, or the things themselves isn't really healthy.

"My first car was a 2008 Toyota Hatchback. I kept it stock aside from some different wheels so most of the time I had it, I never felt confident enough to talk to car people at car meets because I was always worried about the question, “Well what do you drive?”  Even though I’m knowledgeable about all makes and interested in everything form Geo Metros to Bugattis, I didn’t feel that I had the credibility if I didn’t have an enthusiast car. I was just broke at the time and didn’t have the luxury of sinking money into modifying my own car or getting a different car. So it wasn’t until I turned 25 and got a new Lexus RCF that I was able feel like a real auto enthusiast. I did love driving it but the car wasn’t me. I’ve always appreciated luxury and sports cars but my natural affinity is towards quirky or older cars. So I ditched the RCF and bought cars I enjoy, cars with different driving experiences, and cars I could educate non enthusiasts on. And that’s how I ended up with a Previa, a C4 Corvette, and 4Runner TRD Pro. I have a van that looks like an egg on the outside, a spaceship on the inside, and drives like nothing else I’ve experienced. The Corvette is a 1996 and it feels so 90s and American. And the 4Runner I take off road regularly which is a thrill of it’s own.

Too many $500 Mercedes with 500,000km or Jags with rebuilt titles - instead of 10 cars, 7 of which are projects and 3 actually drive, why don&#39;t I spend the same money and get a pristine E34 M5, a 944 Turbo and an SL600?  </p>

"Honestly, the answer to the video maker's problem is humility. Acceptance that you're not always going to have the fastest, prettiest, or most expensive item. Sure, social media is responsible to enabling this negative feeling but it's been around forever. People always want more and envy is unavoidable. Learning to appreciate what you have for what it is helps cope with that emotion.

I loved all my cars and they've all made me happy regardless of power or styling. I'm fortunate to own a Camaro right now, but even I'm aware that there are a plethora of vehicles that can smoke me.

"You should never buy a car or house or anything that's really expensive like that for other people (Unless you drive clients around and it can actually help you in some way there). It's ridiculous. You really need to evaluate yourself if you are buying expensive things so other people will think better of you.

Great video, although in general I certainly don't agree with ""Cars won't make you happy"", unless the statement is that having only cars won't make you happy (Maybe for some, but most people need more meaningful things in their life in addition to cars). I saw a comment saying the title should be ""Social media won't make you happy"". The video does seem to be more about that. You could easily replace ""cars"" with something like else like ""An expensive house"".

Buy a car that you enjoy being in, enjoy driving, looking at, and is in your budget. It's gonna make you unhappy if you're stressed about money and have to cut back on other things you like. Though I guess a good enough car could make up for that, but cars are unpredictable with what goes wrong, I just don't think it's good to live like that. Stick with what you can afford, it ain't hard these days with how good modern cars. If you want safety, fun, relatively quiet interior, modern amenities, reliability, it ain't that hard to find. Mazda3, BRZ/86, Mustang, Civic Si, Miata, WRX, 370Z are some new examples and they all have old examples you can buy as well. And there's a bunch of other used cars I could think of. I am 100% that having a car I like and enjoy driving will make me happy, no doubt about that. Will it be the sole reason for my happiness, no, definitely not, but it will increase my happiness absolutely.

Of course, what you require may change depending on what you grew up and are used to.

Point is, do not buy things for other people. I guess I should consider myself lucky that I never got bit by that bug. I'm not sure why. Maybe social media? I'm 23, I used a Nokia 6XXX brick phone and did not get a smartphone till my first year of college and only had Facebook, which I did not really use too often.

But I don't think seeing other people with nice things changes the reasons WHY you want them. What causes that? I'll admit I dress nicely because I want to look nice essentially for other people you could say (I don't care as much anymore because I have a girlfriend), but I don't think that's unhealthy. I thrift clothes or buy nice ones off eBay, it ain't expensive to look good. And I feel good about myself as well.

But a car? A house? Christ, why would you spend shit tons of money and care what other people think? I am so glad I do not give care about keeping up with the Jones, I wish everybody who has that issue could be rid of it, that ain't no way to live life. Think about what you want, first and foremost, and what will make you happy. Except if what will make you happy is other people validating you, fix that, there's something wrong with that.","<div class=""md""><p>You should never buy a car or house or anything that&#39;s really expensive like that for other people (Unless you drive clients around and it can actually help you in some way there).

"Great video and my experience is the same. I used to love cars when younger. I can tell you all the stats, engine types, and all that about a car. I was given a 94 accord by my brother. A hand me down. It was amazing. I worked on that car every chance I could get. I learned car maintenance, manual driving, and generally all about cars. Had it for over 7 years.

I graduated college and my eyes were bigger than my mouth. I wanted to step up. A 2004 sti was my dream car. I needed one to make me happy. Reality was I had nowhere the money for one. I've only ever had a car because my brother gave me one instead of selling it for scrap. 

I'm now in the workforce. Scrapping just get by and pay my bills. The dream kept on getting further away every day. The world is starting grinding me down. On top of this my car is starting to really show it's a 20 year old car. Things constantly breaking and it was time to let the car go. I didn't have money for a back up plan. Again, my brother to the rescue only this time I bought his old clunker from him but it mostly worked. This is when it started.

I started hating cars. Even the idea of doing an oil change ruined my mood for the day. I didn't want to do any car related thing. It always cost money I didn't have. Then my social media feeds started to change. I was removing all these car channels because I was bitter. I had become bitter and defeated. Why can't I afford these cars? What did I do wrong with my life? How are they buying a car every week? 

The voices become more sad and desperate. Why are you a loser? Why did you fail in life? It's fucked me up because this is where I still am. I'm much older now and still nowhere near able to afford the 2004 sti. I work just as much, save just as much, and just as responsible as the next person.

Only difference now is anything I save is for when an emergency happens. And those who live this way know emergency happen on a routine sucking what you had saved dry and back to step one. Cars used to be my passion and love now doing a simple battery jumpstart for someone ruins my mood. It's sobers me up to my reality I'll never experience life. Feels like I'll never be happy.","<div class=""md""><p>Great video and my experience is the same. I used to love cars when younger.

"I completely agree with this. My feelings on this have also matured due to my faith & life experience. 

I once owned a 87 GN that I poured all my money & time into.  I drag raced it occasionally, showed it here & there. I was trying to improve the braking & handling on a platform that really wasn't designed to do so. I quickly realized that all the car guys I was hanging out with were all perusing the same endless task of trying to have the fastest/nicest car.  The internet puts all of the ""keeping up with the Jones'"" at our finger tips so easily as well.  I'm much happier enjoying the dependability of  a stock car, something I can afford & not being so scared of someone looking at my car with such desire that theft becomes a problem.

 Living within my means & doing things with my family brings me much greater joy. So it's a regular thing for the kids & I to move the car seats to my car & go find a curvy road. I may not own the fastest car or garner all the attention at a C&C, but I enjoy it & that's enough.","<div class=""md""><p>I completely agree with this.

"PALO ALTO, U.S./NEW YORK/TOKYO -- Japanese automobile manufacturers face a new challenge of drastically reducing gasoline vehicles sold in California -- and have less than four years to do it.

The state's air regulators on Thursday approved new rules to phase out all gas-burning vehicles sales by 2035. The California Air Resources Board order goes into effect for the 2026 model year, when automakers are required to have 35% of new sales be of zero-emission vehicles.

Since California accounts for 12% of the U.S. auto market, car manufacturers have little choice but to comply with the mandate.

""The specifics are strict, but it's been clear for some time that they plan to eliminate gasoline vehicles by 2035,"" said an executive at a Japanese automaker. ""We're drawing up product plans to accommodate it.""

After 2026, California will require automakers to make zero-emission vehicles 68% of new sales for the 2030 model year, then 100% for 2035 models. The types of automobiles that make the grade include electric vehicles, fuel-cell vehicles and plug-in hybrids with all-electric driving ranges of 80 kilometers or more.

When it comes to green vehicles, Toyota Motor and other Japanese peers specialize in conventional hybrids that cannot be plugged to charge batteries. Because California does not recognize conventional hybrids as zero-emission vehicles, new sales of these autos will be banned in California in 2035 as well.

Even for plug-in hybrids, the California Air Resources Board will limit sales of that category to 20% of all zero-emissions vehicles. This is done in the interest of mainstreaming vehicles that emit no exhaust fumes.

Automakers that fail to comply with these rules will face a fine of up to $20,000 for each vehicle sold over the cap.

About 853,000 new vehicles were purchased in California in the first half of this year, according to the California New Car Dealers Association. EVs and plug-ins accounted for 17.9% of that volume, and much of that result can be attributed to Tesla's growth.

Only about 4% of vehicles Toyota sold in California during the first half were zero-emission, according to data from S&P Global. Honda Motor's share was a paltry 0.3%.

For Nissan Motor, which has expended effort on marketing the all-electric Leaf, zero-emission vehicles made up 6% of the sales mix in the first half. All three automakers find themselves far short of meeting the 35% quota a mere four years away.

Right now, Toyota is the leading seller of all new vehicles by a decisive margin. Honda and other Japanese automakers are ranked high as well.

But in terms of zero-emissions vehicles, Tesla is the unquestioned champion. Hyundai Motor and Kia are the nearest rivals while Toyota is in fourth place. If zero emissions becomes the prerequisite in selling new vehicles, then big shake-up of the market is in store.

Toyota is not sitting idly by. The company came out with a plan to sell 3.5 million EVs globally by 2030. Although Toyota has not released numbers specific to the U.S., it plans to make all Lexus vehicles sold in the market all-electric in 2030.

""Ford EVs are selling better than expected,"" said a Toyota executive, indicating the company is hurrying to expand its roster of electrics to meet growing U.S.

Mazda Motor, which counts the U.S. market as a major earner, released the MX-30 EV exclusively in California in October. But only 324 units of the model sold between January and July of this year.

""The situation in the U.S. differs from state-to-state, and the environment changes rapidly,"" said a Mazda executive.","<div class=""md""><p>PALO ALTO, U.S./NEW YORK/TOKYO -- Japanese automobile manufacturers face a new challenge of drastically reducing gasoline vehicles sold in California -- and have less than four years to do it.</p>

"Random story time. I'm three stories up in an apartment and there's a super-strong gasoline smell.

I go down to the partly underground parking garage and a guy is working on his truck, draining his gas tank into a large shallow wide-open pan.

The apartment complex was old (1980's) so a fire would have probably been devastating.

He was an older guy much bigger than me. It's the one time in my life I put on a scary face and told him he needed to stop immediately, or I'd call the fire department and dial 911. 

I couldn't stay due to the risk, so went out for a 30 minute walk. Fortunately, when I got back everything was cleaned up AND a couple firefighters were putting their things away.

"Is there any definite list of Lightning prices? There was this “leaked” document a month ago, but it looked kinda fake. 

Cool features like the home charging, ventilated seats, and big 15” screen only came in the Lariat trim and above (Lariat 2nd most expensive), and from that rumored price sheet, it would cost above $60k before the $7k extended range battery. 

Some speculated there was trickery in the “300 mi EV truck under $40k” line where a stripped down fleet version cost $40k, while you needed to get a trim at a min of $50k before adding in the $7k 300 mi battery. 

A fairly premium gas F150 Lariat costs maybe $59k, and I feel the EV version being nearly $70k is a huge jump, even for an EV. Lower trims only have cloth seats… $55k+ for a low range EV with cloth seats? Even Tesla is a better value if this is the case.","<div class=""md""><p>Is there any definite list of Lightning prices?

<p>Cool features like the home charging, ventilated seats, and big 15” screen only came in the Lariat trim and above (Lariat 2nd most expensive), and from that rumored price sheet, it would cost above $60k before the $7k extended range battery. </p>

<p>Some speculated there was trickery in the “300 mi EV truck under $40k” line where a stripped down fleet version cost $40k, while you needed to get a trim at a min of $50k before adding in the $7k 300 mi battery. </p>

<p>A fairly premium gas F150 Lariat costs maybe $59k, and I feel the EV version being nearly $70k is a huge jump, even for an EV. Lower trims only have cloth seats… $55k+ for a low range EV with cloth seats? Even Tesla is a better value if this is the case.</p>

Price may be close but I don’t see anything about margins and they don’t mention the cost of the battery pack/powertrain.  Obviously all trucks they make they can get parts at scale.

From a marketing standpoint its a decent move. While other manufacturers make the switch they will have a larger market share of the remaining demand for ICE vehicles. This asserts themselves as the company that will stay and pick up the stragglers so other companies won't think about sticking around for the last remaining profits. If the cows running dry saying you will be there til the end is a great way to get others to focus on making the switch sooner as there will be competition when things dry up.,"<div class=""md""><p>From a marketing standpoint its a decent move.

"This is a great video and as a fan of RCR it's interesting to note our similarities in background. I've been a life-long car nut and have a BA in history, rather than English, but nevertheless it's an educational background that lends itself to appreciating someone skilled in words. Likewise, it was study of history that led me to Robert McNamara, Ford, and the Falcon, specifically as a teenager viewing the documentary Fog of War concerning McNamara. 

We also seem to have acquired our Falcons in a similar timeframe (He likely did so earlier.). I drove up to a small town 90 minutes from where I live, looked at the car, and made the handshake deal that day, Veteran's Day of last year. When seeing the video of the Falcon I was thrilled to hear the invocation of McNamara and Iacocca because I'd literally given the seller a borderline history lecture about the car in an attempt to built rapport and exit a negotiation in which the seller knew what he had and in which it was blindingly obvious that I wanted the car badly in one piece.

My Falcon is a '61 Futura coupe, originally Corinthian white with a whorehouse red interior. I like the styling and as my first attempt at a restoration I felt it wise to stick with a car that has extremely good parts availability thanks to its commonality with the first-generation Mustang. It still has the original 144 six as far as I'm aware, with a three speed manual on the column and it was in rough shape but drivable, having been resurrected after spending 30+ years in a barn. The body is decent with relatively little rust, the powertrain is actually okay but worn, the brakes and suspension were totally shot, as is the interior. Nevertheless I feel that it's a relatively achievable restoration and I intend to keep it largely stock. A useful thing about having spent an undergraduate education studying history is that it makes researching details for a classic restoration an exercise in skills already exercised. Incidentally a few history professors here have some absolutely gorgeous restored classics that they daily drive, a sixties Fiat spyder of some kind and a '67 Mustang convertible coming immediately to mind.

These comments are clear indication everyone just skipped over the Falcon build episodes. I used to be a RCR hater. Namely because I'm a huge Mustang fanboy and one of the first videos I saw was a less than favorable review on the refreshed s197 v6 which had a ton of praise practically everywhere else. Coupled with not much in terms of reviewing the actual performance of the car I wasn't a huge fan. I have to say I've come around since. I didn't get at the time but it's not really about cold hard numbers those reviews are a dime a dozen. He really does a great job of putting vehicles in context. With time and improvements it's easy to forget why particular cars where considered great at the time or why it made since to even release it. I'd still like to see a more technical show for older cars. There isn't really one that covers this many older cars and certainly not one this well done. I definitely enjoy the reviews and to me at least it does seem like he's gotten at least more technical while retaining the style he began with. ,"<div class=""md""><p>These comments are clear indication everyone just skipped over the Falcon build episodes.

That's a damn shame because Shell's V-Power Nitro+ Premium is at the top of Top Tier Fuel. When I fill up I'm getting an extra 2 mpg from my boosted M275. That's almost 50 miles more driving range. It's not just mine. My sister's 2008 Lexus RX350 sees about 20 miles more range from Shell. Of course I fill up at sunrise when fuel is coolest and therefore densest within every gallon but no other gasoline has produced that kind of fuel efficiency. [Project Farm's famous test on Nito+ fuel](https://youtu.be/8uIsbRaArvk?si=1NmAcyolW0zE5PMm) on Youtube led me to try it. Chevron's Techron is absent from here in Maryland and it's excellent consistent engine cleaning fuel.

"Regarding leaded fuel in aviation, the FAA actively prevents innovation in aircraft powerplants. The big challenge is using unleaded gas in high compression high horsepower piston aircraft engines, which are subject to detonation and preignition, because they still use magnetos (1930’s tech basically). Electronic ignition with variable timing solves much of this…which it’s doing for the experimental aircraft side of aviation. 

But really this is all moot, because there are two new fuels that are unleaded, reliable, and proven to work with all existing piston aviation engines: GAMI inc’s G100UL and slightly behind them, Swift Fuel’s unleaded fuel. Alas, the FAA won’t approve those fuels because it would put an end to the FAA “Piston Aviation Fuel Initiative” or PAFI, which has a multi million dollar annual budget and has been in operation for more than a decade, with no progress.

8% increase mandated for each of Model Years 24 and 25.

10% increase mandated for Model Year 26, projected to increase the estimated fleetwide average by as much as 10mpg relative to MY21.

NHTSA suggests this new regime will yield a 33% improvement in gas mileage over MY21 vehicles, on average.

Fuel use is projected to decrease by >200M gallons through 2050; carbon emissions are projected to be reduced by 2.5B metric tons.

Of the four options that NHTSA prepared, this was Alternative 2.5, which was put forth as their preferred Alternative in the proposed rulemaking.

Having more fuel efficient vehicles on the road is a *good thing*, but having many new vehicles with a useless tire-repair kit, and a country with large stretches of road that well exceeds the distance a tire-repair kit claims it can work are problematic (even ignoring that some damage cannot be repaired with a kit). I realize there will be a ""once exceptions start, where will they stop?!"" reply, but I feel like a spare tire on a vehicle is a very special case (""safety critical"") that really has no analogue.

"I still think they're all going to find out there's no way they can hit the 2030 ICE phase-out all these manufacturers are wanting to hit. I bet a lot of them are secretly still maintaining some ICE development money just in case. Electrics will slowly become more prevalent for sure, but they still need to work out issues like how to replace/recycle batteries, how to maintain production with all the exotic metals required (and related environmental concerns), and make replacing batteries cost effective. Not to mention, even if they match or exceed the range of ICE vehicles there's still the issue of if you run out of gas, you can bring a can of it to your vehicle to fill it up quickly. It's much harder to bring a way to charge your vehicle quickly.


The problem is the cool thing is for governments to try and kill ICE in one fell swoop and for manufacturers to earn accolades to satisfy investors by making ""bold"" commitments. A much more promising and realistic step should be to add hybrid systems, or do like the old Chevy Volt and have a dinky ICE engine to charge the battery to eliminate one of the biggest issues with electrics- range.","<div class=""md""><p>I still think they&#39;re all going to find out there&#39;s no way they can hit the 2030 ICE phase-out all these manufacturers are wanting to hit. I bet a lot of them are secretly still maintaining some ICE development money just in case. Electrics will slowly become more prevalent for sure, but they still need to work out issues like how to replace/recycle batteries, how to maintain production with all the exotic metals required (and related environmental concerns), and make replacing batteries cost effective. Not to mention, even if they match or exceed the range of ICE vehicles there&#39;s still the issue of if you run out of gas, you can bring a can of it to your vehicle to fill it up quickly. It&#39;s much harder to bring a way to charge your vehicle quickly.</p>

Cars on offer are very expensive (inflation, low inventory) yet ""compromised"" which makes it really depressing to feel this pressure to act before 2025. 

Some examples: lousy steering in the Supra and Z. Too much turbo lag in 718 Cayman and Cayman S. Huge size and weight of the new M2 and 240i (also lack of manual in the latter).

But when I look at 20 year old cars like E46 M3 without electronic steering and turbos they are in need of refresh or full on restoration (subframe, VANOS, suspension, paint etc.) and you end up spending almost the same as outright buying one of these new cars, but they would've come without any of the headaches of dealing with bodyshops and engine builders.

"I agree the party is soon coming to an end for ICE, but I think their sudden demise is significantly exaggerated.

Yes, EV's are the future, but at least from America I still see a lot of reluctance to move to EV's.  They're still considerably more expensive than ICE vehicles, there's ownership issues, there's trust of new technology issues, and there's some are ""too intentionally different"" to get mass appeal  (many... maybe most? people don't want their dashboard to be covered in giant displays and pads).  There's also the issue of additional charging stations, and power plants.

So as more and more manufacturers move production from ICE to electrics, I predict you'll see a squeeze on ICE vehicles.  Older people drive new car purchases, and these older people will be slower to adopt EV's than expected.

Then there's the used ICE vehicles.  They're not going to just vanish in 2030 or 2040... they'll be around for decades, especially if manufacturers increasingly push microtransaction BS into cars, like BMW's stupid heated seats.  So the cars being built before these features take the industry by storm could be highly desirable down the road.

The 2030 EV/ICE ratios - it's a classic overpromise.  Auto execs are targeting a lofty 52% rate now.  It's 4.6% today.","<div class=""md""><p>I agree the party is soon coming to an end for ICE, but I think their sudden demise is significantly exaggerated.</p>

">Earlier this month, Chinese oil giant Sinopec made a surprise announcement that mostly flew under the radar. It’s now expecting gasoline demand in China to peak this year, two years earlier than its previous outlooks.


>The main culprit? The surging number of electric vehicles on the road.


>China has been the largest driver of global growth for refined oil products like gasoline and diesel over the last two decades. But EV adoption rates in China are now soaring, with August figures likely to show plug-in vehicles hitting 38% of new passenger-vehicle sales. That’s up from just 6% in 2020 and is starting to materially dent fuel demand.

>Fuel demand in two and three-wheeled vehicles is already in structural decline, with BNEF estimating that 70% of total kilometers traveled by these vehicles already switched over to electric. Fuel demand for cars will be the next to turn, since well over 5% of the passenger-vehicle fleet is now either battery-electric or plug-in hybrid. The internal combustion vehicle fleet is also becoming more efficient due to rising fuel-economy targets.

>Diesel demand for heavier vehicles will keep growing for a bit longer, but even there a seismic shift is underway. Electric, fuel cell and battery-swapping options have quickly climbed to 12% of light commercial vehicle sales and 4% to 5% of medium and heavy commercial vehicle sales. That heavy-duty figure is likely to climb to over 10% by 2025.

>Vehicles used for ride-hailing in China are far more likely to be electric — their share is nearing 40% of the fleet — than those that are privately owned. Electric ride-hailing vehicles are also more productive than their gasoline-powered counterparts, accounting for 50% of the kilometers traveled on market leader Didi’s ride-hailing platform in December.


>There are economic reasons for the rise of EVs in ride-hailing. Yes, they have a higher upfront cost than internal combustion vehicles, but they’re cheaper to operate on a per-kilometer basis, a big advantage for high-mileage ride-hailing drivers.


>Convincing everyone to adopt a new technology can be a slog at first. The microwave oven took two decades of lukewarm sales to reach a tenth of US households. Then came the 1980s, and quicker than you could say “Hot Pockets,” microwaves had spread to nearly every kitchen. The quick part of the technology adoption curve is playing out now with electric vehicles.

"Of course the American Petroleum Institute would claim to have data that goes against every other study on EV vs. ICE carbon footprint. Oddly enough they don't want to get into the details. 

I calculated the break even point on my SR+ on a relatively dirty grid at just over two years. Anyone who claims that EVs have a higher lifetime carbon footprint compared to ICE is full of shit. In most cases its significantly lower. 

I also think its interesting to note that they picked one of the lowest carbon emitting ICE sedans vs. going with a direct Model 3 competitor like the 3 Series. Basically when you give ICE every advantage the outcome is still the same.

Speaking for myself, I was always naturally attracted to lowered cars. I would like to own all kinds of cars. What attracted me to the stance is community is the ease of entry. They say it later in the video after the car show. Coilovers and wheels and you're done.  


What lowering my car has done it demystify the rest of my car. Suspension is fairly simple, so are wheels. Undue some bolts, remove the springs and struts, replace. In the process though, I'm removing panels, checking my brakes and learning about the rest of the suspension. While doing the coilovers you notice the cv axle is on its way now. Well that's only a few extra bolts and you can pop that out. Working on cars from the east coast, you now learn to handle adversity in the form of rust. Soon you're hammering on parts, drilling out snapped bolts. After all this you should probably use a torque wrench because suspension parts are pretty vital. Through this one job you've learned a few skills and some confidence. Now maybe engine work isn't so scary.

"Probably one of the most in-depth videos that actually shows the stupity of ""stanced"" cars, humble mechanic has a good video one of the Jetta.

I started work at 16 in a custom/modification bodyshop in 2003, we had a massive modified car scene and it lasted until About 09. Basically every car had some form of lowering (coilovers were still v expensive). Served my time in crash repair then moved to a more motorsport oriented garage which delt with actual performance, rally/drift or tracktoy. 

My first car, a xr2i fiesta had 2nd hand -80mm spax lowering suspension, and 16"" azevs with 205 tires. Looked savage and with decent grip it was stupid ammouts of fun and extremely confidence inspiring, I've always wanted to work the suspension first even with shit cars( old set of jic magic coilovers I had in 5 different ae101 Corollas) even the 4efe engine ones were fun. 

It was so feckin common to test drive a customer car for whatever concern the customer had and end up mistyfied at how they managed to keep it on the road with bearings and bushes hanging out of them, even more common to be repairing a damaged car that somehow miraculously just lost grip and tram-lined into a tree/ other car. 

None of the above would have been anywhere near as stupid and extreme as the modern example of ""stance"", these were cars that had been lowered excessively and the alignment of control arms was just incorrect, along with hard suspension and slightly too much camber it created strange/unusual and unpredictable handling. This modern interpretation is taking that to a whole other level.

Notching chassis is an art form that few understand in the stance community, with old cars it can be done properly but with modern cars that incorporate crumple zones and are intended to deflect the impact of a collision away from the cabin. The design an integrity of the chassis legs are very important at that moment nobody what's to happen.

"This is _genius_.  

For those that didn't read, they're offering up to $9,500 to households that make less than $70k/year in the Bay Area who have a 2005 or older vehicle that's been registered in the Bay Area for at least 2 years.  Low income car buyers can find themselves in 2 very bad situations:

First, you buy an older car because it's cheaper.  This means that you're spending more money on repairs, and a higher APR as well.  Despite having a lower payment comparatively, it will cost you relatively more in the long run.

Second, you don't have any money to put down.  Not having any money to put down means you're financing a higher percentage of the car's value.  This means a higher APR.  Which means you're underwater and can lead to bad financial moves in the future.  

This (hopefully) helps both of those scenarios.  People will be buying brand new cars.  Buying brand new cars on it's own helps with reliability down the road because the cars are all under warranty.  EV's are next level reliable because they have almost no moving parts.  By offering a cash rebate (if that's how it's set up) it will lower the initial costs and lower the amount financed to give people the lowest APR they've likely ever had.  This will also save them money in the long run.  

And on top of all that, they're attacking one of the largest producers of CO2 emissions in the Bay Area.  The rep from BAAQMD says that 40% of emissions in the area are from commuters.

Ninja Edit:  My one real issue with this is what they're doing with those cars traded in.  I read into it and it looks like they're destroying the old cars.  Which could be a bummer depending on how you look at it.","<div class=""md""><p>This is <em>genius</em>.  </p>

"I’m doing the math here and this program seems rather comical to me and as a car dealer I’m pretty good at automotive math.

Ok.. Bay Area... max income of $50k a year.  Let’s assume this is a $28k base Nissan Leaf.  $28k, minus the $9500 that’s $18,500. And then there’s the federal tax credit which is ***up to*** $7,500. But if you just take the head of household standard deduction... your federal income taxes are at most $2,000 so that’s just a $2,000 net tax credit.  So that’s $16,500 but you’re probably paying sales tax on the entire $28k so with registration, dealer fees, etc... probably back up to $20k, realistically $22k because that’s a tax credit not cash given at signing.

If you make $50k a year in the Bay Area you’re taking home roughly $3700 a month. So you’ll have to finance this $22k purchase, so let’s be conservative and say you’ve saved $2k down so you’re financing $18k and you stretch it out to 72 months at say 3%.  Off the top of my head that’s like $310 a month.  Plus you’ll need full coverage insurance which conservatively is $175/mo vs the probably $80 you were paying for liability on the beater. 

Realistically in the above scenario, you could get approved with good credit but I’m not sure many people making $50k a year in the super high COL area that is the Bay Area are prepared to have their monthly expenses jump $380-390 or so.

"I did a little experiment between ethanol/non-ethanol gas a year or so ago.

I do the same drive every week to work five days a week and to the grocery store twice a week. For one month I used only shell 93 octane E10 gasoline from the same station. I averaged 20 mpg for the whole month and between 19-21 mpg per week.

I then drove the tank to near empty and used only 91 octane 0 ethanol gas from Caseys (only place in town with 0 ehtanol fuel), when I first switched my fuel trims started to read slightly negative (AKA less fuel needed). After I gave it a week to ensure that the ethanol gas had been used up, I logged my mpg's again for another month.

With E0 91 octane my monthly mpg average was 24 mpg. Weekly mpg's varied from 22-26 mpg, the car idled smoother and seemed to have slightly more power as well.

Newer cars do fine with ethanol but I think that all stations should be required to have one pump that sells E0, this stuf is cancerous for older cars and leads to higher maintenance costs and substantially lower fuel economy.","<div class=""md""><p>I did a little experiment between ethanol/non-ethanol gas a year or so ago.</p>

"One thing I can tell from this conversation for sure:

If the amount of bickering, ignorance and flat out lies in this thread is indicative of the general attitude towards energy policy, as a species we're not going to solve anything and are going to burn the planet to a crisp.

A summary of my reactions to the various comments:

* It should be obvious that you need energy to make an e-fuel alternative.
* Solar and wind are still not being prioritized as much as they should be for energy generation. Mandatory rooftop solar on new construction is a step in the right direction, new technology of cheap stationary storage (like air-iron batteries) solves the storage problem - but for some reason solar adoption just isn't very sexy anymore and residential wind never caught on. Both should be bigger.
* An excess of solar during the day would be perfect to power e-fuel generation, building an overcapacity of solar would get that done.
* Although yes, hydrogen would be more efficient, e-fuels would at least tide us over until existing cars are all replaced.
* If we went all-in on nuclear, there's enough uranium in the mines for about 50 years of power before it all runs out.
* The bigger problem with nuclear is that you have to play geopolitics to get uranium (Kazakhstan alone produces 41% of the world's supply) and you need armed guards at every stage of the process so terrorists or natural disasters don't irradiate the nearest town and make it uninhabitable for 100 years.
* Ok, neat if we can extract uranium from seawater, but that seems like a gamble on technology that might not scale and may also be very expensive leading to an increase in price of energy produced.
* Overall I still think society would be better off with building efficient clean and safe public transit for commuters (which waste the most driving miles), getting most cars off the road in cities and reclaiming a huge amount of wasted space which is used for parking. This would benefit enthusiasts also with less traffic, so long as you're not trying to commute into a city.)","<div class=""md""><p>One thing I can tell from this conversation for sure:</p>

"I have to admit I still struggle to grasp this aesthetic. I think it's just best to admit that different peoples' brains are wired differently, and some people will inherently find certain things more attractive than others no matter how much reason or justification you put into it. And I guess that's OK.

Taking into account what this video is trying to communicate and adding it to my own experiences talking to owners of stanced cars at meets and shows, it really feels like stance is just a gateway drug to getting into cars for real.

It allows people just getting into the scene to customize their cars for cheap and make them stand out from the NPC traffic. It makes a statement that they are interested in cars, and I suppose that is where the community aspect of it comes from. You get to feel like you belong, that your car is special, that it is your own and you have a personal stamp on it, without breaking the bank. It feels like it occupies the same space in the tuning landscape as ricing did in the 00s, except instead of decals, ebay body kits, and non-functional rear wings it's coilovers, camber kits, and air bags.

At the end of the day most people don't start out as hardcore car guys. Building an autocross or track car (or even a drift car) as your first car and having it actually look special is just too high of a commitment for a casual/entry-level car enthusiast. So I guess if we didn't have stance, far fewer people would get siphoned into the car addiction to begin with.","<div class=""md""><p>I have to admit I still struggle to grasp this aesthetic.

"I'm pretty hyped for this! A few general thoughts as someone who has driven an Elise, Evora, and 4C below!

Really hoping the 2.0L version feels like an ever so slightly more grown up version of the Alfa Romeo 4C while also hoping that the V6 version feels like a slightly more edgy Evora.

If it's a 2-seater I feel like a curb weight of around 2,800lbs has to be possible, which should give it a nice distinction compared to the Cayman which is growing heavier and more GT-ish each year. 

If they are able to reduce the weight it should give the car some noticeable performance increases over the Evora even while having the same basic powerplant. 

A little bummed that the V6 has an auto transmission as opposed to a DCT for the non-manual version. Lotus actually did a good job with the Evora's auto, but I can't see how they'd realistically improve upon it without significantly updating the transmission, which I'd doubt they do. The problem is that the Evora's auto is amazing for its age...but not great compared to say a ZF. 

I think the real story here could be the styling. The Evija is sexy as hell. Assuming this pulls some design cues from that and at least somewhat holds its own in looks compared to the Evora, Elise, and Exige, this thing could easily be the best looking car you can grab for $60K-ish. 

I don't think this car necessarily has to be fast it just has to be more fun to drive than a C8 or a Cayman without feeling blatantly compromised (aside from giving up some luggage space). If it looks more exotic than a C8 and Cayman and feels more engaging to drive it will be a hit!

Will also be curious to see how this car influences Evora and 4C prices. Both of those cars are hovering pretty stoutly in the $50-$70K range. I think it's much harder to justify those prices when you can get a new Emira for $65K that will offer a similar driving experience.","<div class=""md""><p>I&#39;m pretty hyped for this!

<p>If it&#39;s a 2-seater I feel like a curb weight of around 2,800lbs has to be possible, which should give it a nice distinction compared to the Cayman which is growing heavier and more GT-ish each year. </p>

<p>If they are able to reduce the weight it should give the car some noticeable performance increases over the Evora even while having the same basic powerplant. </p>

<p>A little bummed that the V6 has an auto transmission as opposed to a DCT for the non-manual version. Lotus actually did a good job with the Evora&#39;s auto, but I can&#39;t see how they&#39;d realistically improve upon it without significantly updating the transmission, which I&#39;d doubt they do. The problem is that the Evora&#39;s auto is amazing for its age...but not great compared to say a ZF. </p>

<p>I think the real story here could be the styling. The Evija is sexy as hell. Assuming this pulls some design cues from that and at least somewhat holds its own in looks compared to the Evora, Elise, and Exige, this thing could easily be the best looking car you can grab for $60K-ish. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t think this car necessarily has to be fast it just has to be more fun to drive than a C8 or a Cayman without feeling blatantly compromised (aside from giving up some luggage space). If it looks more exotic than a C8 and Cayman and feels more engaging to drive it will be a hit!</p>

<p>Will also be curious to see how this car influences Evora and 4C prices. Both of those cars are hovering pretty stoutly in the $50-$70K range. I think it&#39;s much harder to justify those prices when you can get a new Emira for $65K that will offer a similar driving experience.</p>

"It's hilarious people ask this question. If you don't live in Houston, chances are there are only one or two refineries in your area. There are probably only one or two pipelines. A few storage farms. So it's always the same crap coming out of the tank into the truck. It has to be, super generic. Now some brands add additives that ""clean"" your system. While leaving different deposits. 

Now where it matters is the maintenance of the station. Doesn't matter if it's a name brand or not. Some bigger stores have corporate maintenance that only comes by every few months. A mom and pop will have a guy that does it more often. The only real difference is how old the filter they are using is. Who knows. But generally speaking that is impossible to tell.

"All the gas is the same.  You know those pipelines we hear about leaking now and then?  All the companies share them.  

For example.  Shell puts a thousand gallons into the pipe at one end and later that day takes a thousand gallons out the other end.  Well thats cool, but the gas takes days to make it down the pipe.  They aren't getting their own gas out, its a common pipeline they everyone uses and it all gets mixed up and exchanged.

"I'm not an expert on the oil economy, but I know that the crude oil refinement is super complicated, and different products get distilled from crude oil at different temperatures. So to my understanding, if you want to refine kerosine for example, you will also end up with butane, gasoline, et cetera, since those vaporise at a lower temperature. Of course, it's not as simple as heating up the oil and then stuffing that vapor in your car, it requires further refinement. But the point is that it is not just the demand for gasoline that affects its production.

And it is not just the amount of its production that affects the price. I recon a lot of it depends on how it is taxed in the future, and at least to me it seems like OPEC+ can pretty much arbitrarily decide the price of petrol, like a lot of it seems to be a political game. Not to go as far as the petrodollar conspiracies, but still.

Anyways, if governments want to incentivise the use of EVs over cars with an ICE, it'd make sense to tax petrol in a way that driving a petrol or diesel car is always more expensive than driving an EV. Right now in some European countries, like the one I live in, EVs get a lot of tax breaks. But as more and more people move to EVs, those tax breaks must go away because the government must make as much money as before, which means taxes for petrol cars must go up to keep EVs cheaper.

So I would guess that at least in Europe it'll keep going up. How far up, don't know. [Here's a picture I took a week ago or so](https://i.imgur.com/0ofkea8.jpg), 98 octane petrol was 1.999€/litre.

<p>And it is not just the amount of its production that affects the price. I recon a lot of it depends on how it is taxed in the future, and at least to me it seems like OPEC+ can pretty much arbitrarily decide the price of petrol, like a lot of it seems to be a political game. Not to go as far as the petrodollar conspiracies, but still.</p>

<p>Anyways, if governments want to incentivise the use of EVs over cars with an ICE, it&#39;d make sense to tax petrol in a way that driving a petrol or diesel car is always more expensive than driving an EV. Right now in some European countries, like the one I live in, EVs get a lot of tax breaks. But as more and more people move to EVs, those tax breaks must go away because the government must make as much money as before, which means taxes for petrol cars must go up to keep EVs cheaper.</p>

<p>So I would guess that at least in Europe it&#39;ll keep going up. How far up, don&#39;t know. <a href=""https://i.imgur.com/0ofkea8.jpg"">Here&#39;s a picture I took a week ago or so</a>, 98 octane petrol was 1.999€/litre. That&#39;s 8.56 USD per gallon, apparently.</p>

"Controlling compression ignition with gasoline is extremely difficult due to the way the fuel burns. By nature, gasoline will ""explode"" more than it really just burns (see all those videos where people light fires with gas and it makes a massive fireball). Gasoline has also been developed to resist autoignition, which is the octane rating.

In a gasoline combustion reaction in an engine, all of the fuel is injected, then the injectors close, the fuel and air mix together and get compressed, and the spark plug fires. That flame propogates out from the plug, through the homogeneous charge, until it reaches the edges of the cylinder. If you get too far away from the optimal (stoichiometric) air fuel ratio, it will run into issues with combustion stability.

Diesel burns quite differently, in a way that is much easier to control. Diesel is rated by its Cetane number, which is the direct opposite of octane. Cetane number is the propensity for autoignition.

In a diesel combustion reaction, the fuel starts being injected while the piston is coming up. Some of that fuel mixes with air, and combined with the very large compression ratio, it autoignites. But, it's still injecting fuel. It continues to inject fuel directly into the already burning mixture until the ECU determines that its enough for that cycle. Even though it's compression ignition, it's not burning all of the fuel at one time. If a gasoline engine were to compression ignite in this style, it would generate incredible pressures in the cylinders and be very difficult to not cause damage.

Mazdas Skyactiv X starts out similar to a gas engine, with a small pocket of homogeneous charge that is ignited by a spark plug, then the rest of it autoignites (which is essentially just knock). With this method, you again aren't burning the whole charge at once. This is just very difficult to control because you are balancing the combustion on a knife edge, but the knife is moving all the time.

Hope this helps, I love talking about this kind of stuff.","<div class=""md""><p>Controlling compression ignition with gasoline is extremely difficult due to the way the fuel burns.

"well because it's really hard to make it work.

with diesel engines, the piston comes up and heats the air well above the kindling temperature of the fuel and the fuel is only injected after the piston reaches TDC.  

this actually gets to an efficiency advantage that gasoline spark ignition motors have over diesel engines.

with a gasoline engine the ultimate strategy is to make the maximum possible pressure at TDC.   now either the fuel gets into the cylinder with the air on the intake stroke or sometime during the compression stroke. and when the engine is pulling at speed the spark always fires early (well before TDC) because it takes time to burn and it's already got to be burnt by the time it's at TDC to have the pressure all the way up.  

the advantage is that with a gasoline engine every drop of fuel gets used to it's maximum potential in the engine.  in a diesel when it's pulling at speed, since the fuel doesn't start getting injected till TDC only the first drop gets used all the way, the second drop coming in at one degree past TDC gets used for 179 degrees, the third drop only 178 degrees.  and because of the volume differential the value of each degree isn't equal, the first degrees are worth the most and the last are barely worth anything at all.   you can see the effect of this in fuel economy stats on big rig engines the bigger engines with more cylinders will have better fuel economy figures than smaller engines.  that's not a typo, the more cylinders it has the more injectors it has and the more capacity it has to get more of the fuel into the cylinders sooner rather than later so it makes more power per drop of fuel.  

now in the diesel engine the combustion chamber reaches the kindling temperature before TDC, if it didn't then the engine would stall, i mean i suppose it could reach it right at the exact moment of TDC, but anything short of that as soon as the fuel comes out it would just not ignite.  

but if you got all the fuel in the cylinder already with the gas version that's what you're going for, you have to reach kindling temp and thus ignition at the exact right moment to make it work.  you also have to have it be varied within the chamber because when it all goes at once, that's called detonation and the shockwaves of each drop of fuel exploding all pile up on top of one another to pulverize your pistons.  and the thing is is that it's variable depending on a whole bunch of factors like load and speed and throttle position.  the spark is easily controlled by a computer and can vary its timing but to control when things autoignite you have to control the specific heat energy of a certain point in the engine.  

now if you don't have all the fuel in the cylinder you're right back to the problem of the diesel engine where the way to make it more efficient is to make it an 18 cylinder instead of a 16 cylinder.","<div class=""md""><p>well because it&#39;s really hard to make it work.</p>

"Gas is not as stable as diesel. Diesel is very easy to predict, and will ignite when you want it to, based on your engine's tune.

Gas is not like that. Its self-combustion is much more unpredictable, and far more destructive than diesel's. Ever heard of ""knock""? That's exactly what it is. Premature combustion because of high temperature, or pressure. Gas engines are not made for that.

I saw Mazda's skyactive engine mentioned here.

"This issue is more about the fuel following the desired ignition type and not the other way around.  Gas and diesel are pretty close to each other chemically.  One was intentionally designed for compression ignition and the other is designed for spark ignition.  There is really no benefit to trying to compression ignite gasoline.

Spark and compression ignition have tradeoffs (regardless of fuel being used) between efficiency, cost, longevity, pollution, power, torque, and toxic masculinity.  So its best to begin your design by picking a combustion type optimized for the use case.

There are a couple gas engines that operate above the auto-ignition compression ratio: Mazda's skyactive for example.  Mazda did this because compression ratio is directly related to efficiency, so its a means to get more MPG out of their cars.  Its barely above the max compression for gasoline and still spark ignited.  Pure compression ignition at that low of a compression ratio would not be predictable or useful.  Even with that, their results are questionable. Mazda cars are not getting phenomenal gas milage compared to the normal compression ratio cars out there.","<div class=""md""><p>This issue is more about the fuel following the desired ignition type and not the other way around.

The ""but electricity comes from coal/gas"" has always been a disingenuous argument for several reasons, you've done a great job of deconstructing the main reason.  But even without that, the point is not to run all of our cars on coal power plants, I don't know why anyone argues this as if we don't ALSO want to generate more power from renewables, or possibly nuclear.

Your bonus fact is useful not just for the ""preppers"" worried about the nuclear holocaust or zombie apocalypse, it's also very useful for short-term shocks to distribution networks.  A few years ago, a derecho (big thunderstorm like a hurricane that isn't spinning) blew through the mid-atlantic area and knocked out power for several days.

If you needed to drive to get food, you might be out of luck if you ran out of gas.  Even if you just wanted to drive somewhere with air conditioning, because the storm came just before a heat wave in the middle of summer.

"Hey man, so this math is good and all, but you left out a huge thing that drastically changes your values:

Thermal efficiency of each process. [Check this plot](https://www.nuclear-power.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/thermal-efficiency-engines-turbines-min.png)

Gasoline has 33.7 kWh/gal, but most modern engines can only extract ~32% of that during a normal drive cycle. So really you have **10.78 kWh/gal** for gasoline.

It looks like your sourced numbers for coal and natural gas have already accounted for the efficiency of turbine power plants, which is in the 37% range for coal and 55% range for natural gas plants.

Coal – gasoline equivalence:

">Gasoline and diesel fuels are not actually stable, and have a limited shelf life.

Lithium ion batteries have a shelf life as well.... ~9 years. During that time their capacity decreases. That's the limiting factor for me. I keep my cars for 15 years or 250k miles. I would have to replace a battery at least once over the ownership of an electric vehicle. The 1st gen Nissan Leaf has the cheapest battery at just over $5k while the Tesla S is around $39k. A battery replacement would wipe out any fuel savings up until that point....

I'm sure others will figure this out as well meaning you'll see a lot of used electric cars selling for cheap just around the 9 year mark.

"> *Unless your car gets 190 mpg and emissions 2.5 times lower than EPA standards, an electric car is still better for the environment. *

This may be true but not in all scenarios, I heard a 'conference' about this on one of the bigger universities of Hungary. 

They say that every car has a 'purpose', there is a scenario when every car can be more efficient than others.

For example for heavier hauling, diesel is obviously the way to go, long distances are also diesel or petrol, whilst city driving is only electric.

I'm not smart enough to understand all of this info , not in the morning, but what they said is basically this:

Creating a battery that holds enough energy is creating CO2. The only way of making EV's viable and *better* in emissions is driving your battery as efficiently as you can, meaning using up about 90% of it.

That way it is true that an electric vehicle has better emissions than other vehicles, but if you arent using your battery efficiently, you are basically wasting it. This is how I 'learned it', simplified.

Also you can draw up a production line as long as you want, but at the end of the day there will be more and more variables missing so its really only a guess how bad are these vehicles really for the enviroment.","<div class=""md""><blockquote>

"Good post, but...

1 - Are those energy values considering the plant efficiency? The average coal plant is about 40% efficient (lower in Europe and US, higher in Asia), which is not that better than modern engines (source [a bit dated, but can look for more recent sources if needed]: https://www.powermag.com/who-has-the-worlds-most-efficient-coal-power-plant-fleet/ ). The most efficient plants are more efficient than the most efficient cars, but the average plant isn't much better than the average car (some sources will give 80+% efficiency for some plants. It's worth noting that is the global efficiency, no the electric. Of those 80+% only approx. 40 are converted to electricity, the rest of the energy is used to produce steam and/or heat utilities (steam, water, molten salts, etc) for other nearby industrial plants or towns, meaning that while that power isn't wasted, it's not going into your car either.

2 - There are other emissions than CO2. For instance, gasoline and diesel have under 10ppm of Sulphur, while Coal has about 1%. So while on the CO2 front it might be about even, on other gases it won't be so close. This is a similar issue with cargo ships and bunker fuel.

Long story short. Yes, in the majority of the scenarios, electric cars are cleaner, but on the extreme scenario of all power coming from coal plants, the argument can easily be made against them. This will obviously change as the grids go greener, but if those places haven't started to diversify yet, who knows when they will.","<div class=""md""><p>Good post, but...</p>

"I really like electric cars and the ideas of them, but I have one problem with them, and it's not the coal burning power plants. It's their batteries. The batteries contain heavy metals whether they are lithium ion or Nickle Metal Hydride (NiMH). This causes a problem from the stand point of what happens when your battery can no longer hold a charge. In the case of a Tesla where (do not quote me on this as I am not 100% sure) the batteries are underneath the rear seats, what do you do? Say the battery lasts 10 years max, after 10yrs what is your tesla worth and what is the cost to put a new battery in the vehicle? (Labor and parts included) Then, does the person decided to keep the car and swap a battery into it or do they trash the entire car (Leaving plastic parts and other pieces to sit in a junkyard). Even if they do replace the battery, the old battery is taken out and recycled. What happens when a large number of these vehicles start to not keep a charge? Where does all the hazardous waste go?

I would like to know if there is something involved in the process of recycling these batteries that allows for them to not be piled up and cause issues.

This is just my main problem with electric cars.

From my understanding, in certain states that focus more heavily on coal and natural gas, it would potentially be more environmentally friendly to go with a hybrid car over an electric car.

It’s possible, but the cost is very high. Most developers won’t fork the cost over if the city does not require it as a base on development. Hopefully we don’t realize it before it’s too late. All comes down to up front cost, city doesn’t want to pay, developer won’t pay unless they get there reduction back for it.</p>

"Great breakdown. No denying electric, or at least hybrid, cars are the future. I’m just not ready to dive in. Right now the value just isn’t there. A car that looks like it should cost $25k going for much more isn’t going to convert the masses. It has/will grab folks that are big fans of the tech, like Apple fans paying $1k for an iPhone, but not many more.

"Those that think paying more for electricity because it's being marketed at 100% renewable are being duped. Your electricity isn't different from that of your neighbors, unless you have solar panels and batteries. If you're happy to pay more than your neighbor, who is on the same circuit and uses the same electricity, then go right ahead.

Here is a quote from my local utility PGE:

> Imagine the electric grid as a giant bathtub that’s constantly being filled from many different faucets — each one representing a different energy source such as hydroelectric, coal, natural gas and wind. Turn on a light, and you drain a little water from the tub. Most of the water entering the tub is from faucets connected to traditional energy sources. But some of the water comes from a growing number of faucets from clean, renewable sources, which contribute pure, clean water. As demand for renewables increases, more clean water goes into the tub — and less of the traditional sources. So the electricity entering the grid on your behalf comes from pollution-free, renewable sources.  

But the renewable electricity doesn't come to your home.

> To help facilitate the sale of renewable electricity nationally, a system was established that separates renewable electricity generation into two parts: the electricity or electrical energy produced by a renewable generator and the renewable “attributes” of that generation. The renewable attributes or “green” attributes are sold separately as renewable energy certificates (RECs). Only one certificate may be issued for each unit of renewable electricity produced. The electricity that was split from the REC is no longer considered “renewable” and cannot be counted as renewable or zero-emissions by whoever buys it. With the purchase of RECs, you are buying the renewable attributes of a specific amount and type of renewable energy generation. You will continue to receive a separate electricity bill from PGE. Your purchase of renewable certificates helps offset conventional electricity generation in the region where the renewable generator is located.  

I would take that extra money your spending on electricity and save it for other environmentally friendly things or investments.","<div class=""md""><p>Those that think paying more for electricity because it&#39;s being marketed at 100% renewable are being duped.

"TL;DR: Yeah even with coal power EVs are a bit better but there are far easier ways to save CO2 with very little downsides compared to EVs.

+1 for making the calculations. You forgot however one crucial aspect: Loss on charging EV. Even tesla states that charging is under optimal conditions only 80% efficient. I doubt that is better for a Leaf. This means you actually need 20% more power to charge than you included. This is far bigger effect than loss on power lines.

Of course it's still better than gasoline BUT it doesn't take into account full energy a car uses over it's lifetime and >50% of that are from production, not actual use. For gas it's about 50%, for EV higher because of the battery. Due to the higher energy use in production, an EV must be more efficient to catch up. For a Tesla with green power (co2 free) it takes about 60k miles to go even, more if your mix contains coal or gas. Point being yeah overall EVs are a bit better even with coal power IF the battery last long enough. But overall the difference isn't that great.

And because the difference isn't that great and there are huge downsides (range and fill-up time, cold weather range,...) there are better ways we could save on CO2 output. First: fly less. Second: Actual CO2 output from cars is not that big compared to power plants and heating. Getting rid of coal and gas would save more CO2 than you ever could with EVs. Add on top of that especially in US!!! better building standards, namely insulation. heating (oil, gas) and AC (power from coal/gas) CO2 output could be cut easily 10x times with proper insulation.","<div class=""md""><p>TL;DR: Yeah even with coal power EVs are a bit better but there are far easier ways to save CO2 with very little downsides compared to EVs.</p>

"I'm sure this is right for the US, but here in Australia, where most of our Power generation for the southern half of the country is done via Brown Coal, not Black Coal, the emissions are significantly worse
Australia, stupidly, has some of the most dirty power in the world, in fact, we had the MOST pollutant power station IN THE WORLD was recently shutdown, The Hazelwood power plant. 

So, im gonna wait out with my terribly inefficient Diesel 4x4 and my petrol guzzling MR2, untill Hydrogen cars become more prevalent - here's pretty much why.

Relying on Batteries, and saying that battery powered cars is the future, is terribly shortsighted, let's admit that Batteries have a limit to how many times they can recharge and discharge, they have a smaller range than petrol/diesel cars and they're practically useless in extreme conditions such as in high heat and extreme cold, battery electric cars take some 40minutes to 3 hours to get a charge, and it has to be done in specific spots, where a normal petrol powered car takes hardly 2-5 minutes to refuel, and you can do it practically anywhere.


Not to mention, im not a homeowner, so for me - and im tipping for others like me, recharging the electric car at home is impossible, as a majority of parking spaces have no access to electricity

Hydrogen cars, when the equipment has properly rolled out, will be able to refuel within 5 minutes - at a petrol station, have a not too dissimilar range to Petrol car, and will also be zero emissions - oops, they'll have 1 emission - Water, and they'll be just as fast and won't have the heat generation problems that current EVs have

Hell, you can't even drive the fancy Tesla racecar fast on a hot day without it wanting to commit seppuku - Tiff Needell only got through 1 hot lap of Spa on a 40 degree day before it was screaming at him to chill out - a petrol car doesn't do that, a petrol car has coolant and radiators. 

Not to say that Battery Electric cars have no future, I'm sure that when mainstream cars are hydrogen, Nana's little run about she goes to bingo in would be battery powered, as she doesn't use it everyday.

I'll wait for hydrogen.

"I wouldn’t necessarily argue that the fuel side of the EV vs ICE is the only metric to look at. EVs currently beat the fuel race, however the total impact is debatable once you consider production. 

When considering the argument EV vs ICE to be fair one needs to consider not just the operational costs and damage to the environment, but also the production costs and damage as well. 

Depending upon who you believe the current production of Lithium batteries is [pretty terrible](https://www.wired.co.uk/article/lithium-batteries-environment-impact) no matter how you skin that cat. Solar Panels unfortunately have a [similar story.](https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaelshellenberger/2018/05/23/if-solar-panels-are-so-clean-why-do-they-produce-so-much-toxic-waste/). Myself, I want to believe that renewable energy is better, however I’m not totally sold that one is necessarily better for the environment than the other - unfortunately the real story is the one that ends up being yielding cheaper energy is viewed as better in the eyes of the consumer - regardless of ethical dogma. 

Unfortunately the laws of thermodynamics is kind of a bitch. Energy is neither created or destroyed, only transformed. Efficiency is getting “lost” as heat.  I’ve yet to see some unbiased reporting that really takes a hard look and complete “total cost of ownership” approach to traditional and alternative power solutions and the associated environmental impacts in a cradle to grave scenario.  e.g a customer an myself used to debate the environmental impact of cloth vs disposable diapers. We rationalized several arguments that could show that disposable diapers were more eco-friendly over cloth. One needs to account for all the water and chemicals used to clean cloth diapers vs just incinerating/tossing/recycling disposable ones.","<div class=""md""><p>I wouldn’t necessarily argue that the fuel side of the EV vs ICE is the only metric to look at.

"Basically what you need to ask yourself before going electric:

**1) How is power made around me? Is it a high percentage of renewable energies, like solar, water, wind energy, or mostly Nuclear?**

If the answer is no, you could still buy an EV, it would be fine, but think with big numbers. What if 10,000 people decided to buy an EV? The non-renewable energy plant would pollute your area, and globally, even more.

**2) How long do I commute?**

Thankfully nowadays many options are avaialable, so even if you are commuting from around 100 km's of a distance, you could pick up an EV. Sure, even if your daily routine is driving around the city you live in, EV's could be the best choice. But there is a slight problem...

**3) I'm worried about range...**

Yes, of course you are. EV's are often called, missleadingly, zero emission cars. There is absolutely no way to make a car emission freely as of 2019, and I dont see it happening in the near future. 

Building an electric motor results in Co2 emissions. Some studies say its about the same as ICE's, some say its more, but its definitely not *less*.

If your daily commute is only 50 km's, or less than that, definitely dont buy the Model 3 with the extra-hyper-super range mode. The bigger the battery, the more emissions it creates, and the less you drive it, the worse your emission / km is. Which means that its highly likely that your emission / km is *worse*, than an ICE's.

Its better for your city, for example. But worse for the globe.

Buy something you'll like, and buy something thats battery will be used daily, heavily. For a 50 km commute, a ~150km range battery is *more efficient*, or more *green* than a 500 km range battery.","<div class=""md""><p>Basically what you need to ask yourself before going electric:</p>

"It definitely varies by region, some regions have a lot more renewables, some more coal, some nuclear, etc.. Manufacturering a battery is worse than an ICE (they also degrade faster). There's also a shift in where the pollution is, a great example of this is the hydrogen buses in Zion national park, there's no emissions inside the park, but making the hydrogen fuel creates pollution elsewhere. An advantage of electric is the reservation of petroleum for air travel, although I hope we can find a better alternative, I don't see a replacement anytime soon. However the collection of petroleum can also be less destructive to the environment vs. mountaintop removal mining, a common practice for coal. Then again, if you live near a nuclear plant then you most likely get your energy from that, so again, which one is better depends heavily on the region.","<div class=""md""><p>It definitely varies by region, some regions have a lot more renewables, some more coal, some nuclear, etc..

But instead converted everything into financial cost with offsetting any CO2 emissions, so that a driver is carbon neutral every step of the way.

The bottom line is that electric cars are more expensive to buy but cheap to run than gasoline vehicles, even when you factor in CO2e emissions. For most electric cars the extra cost doesn't balance out during the lifetime of the car.

Quick example, Tesla cars are between $30,000 and $80,000, a comparable second hand gasoline car is between $2,000 and $10,000, if you spent the $20,000 to $70,000 saving from the gasoline car on CO2 emission offsets at $10 per tonne, it would cover the CO2e emissions from driving around 5,000,000 miles.

CO2 offsetting would have to be around $300 per tonne to make it cost effective to choose to buy an electric car over a second hand gasoline car.

"Good job! Here's my similar breakdown, though it is less rigorous than yours:  


 

\>""EVs aren't green, since the wall socket they're plugging into likely connects to a fossil fuel fired power plant, therefore they must pollute just as much as gas powered cars""

Let's do a bit of research to see if that’s true.  
An electric motor is around 90% efficient at turning stored energy into wheel motion ([http://www.popularmechanics.com/science/mythbusters/projects/4264025](http://www.popularmechanics.com/science/mythbusters/projects/4264025)).  

For comparison the average internal combustion engine is around 15-25% efficient depending on displacement and fuel type, losing most of the energy in gasoline as waste heat. ([http://ffden-2.phys.uaf.edu/102spring2002\_web\_projects/z.yates/zach's%20web%20project%20folder/eice%20-%20main.htm](http://ffden-2.phys.uaf.edu/102spring2002_web_projects/z.yates/zach%27s%20web%20project%20folder/eice%20-%20main.htm))  

Therefore, an electric car at this stage consumes between 3 and 6 times less energy \*per mile driven\* than a gas car, which in turn incurs less pollution at the power plant. It's worth noting here that combined cycle coal plants are around 60% efficient (http://www.siemens.com/innovation/en/news/2011/efficiency-record-of-combined-cycle-power-plant.htm), a huge improvement over the paltry efficiency of an automotive engine. This is because of machinery which uses the waste heat to generate additional power but also because the larger you make an internal combustion engine the more efficient it can be.  
Nationally just 27.4% of electricity comes from coal ([https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.php?id=427&t=3](https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.php?id=427&t=3) And 36.4% of the grid is ghg emissions free stuff like nuclear and renewables. In my state nearly half the energy comes from hydroelectric (http://www.oregon.gov/ENERGY/Pages/Oregons\_Electric\_Power\_Mix.aspx). Charging from that mix is substantially better than driving a gas powered car which unavoidably gets 100% of it's power from fossil fuels. 

So, what about losses? Typical charging loss for lithium ion batteries is around 1% ([http://batteryuniversity.com/learn/article/charging\_lithium\_ion\_batteries](http://batteryuniversity.com/learn/article/charging_lithium_ion_batteries)). Average line loss for power transmission is 7% ([http://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.cfm?id=105&t=3](http://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.cfm?id=105&t=3)). If you take the efficiency of generating power in your own state and then sending it over powerlines to your home, also in your own state and compare that to the process of drilling for oil at sea, shipping it to shore in bunker oil burning tanker vessels, refining it onshore, then burning some of the resulting gasoline to truck it to gas stations nationwide it becomes pretty clear which method of getting 'fuel' into your car is more efficient and environmentally friendly. 

Check out this MIT study confirming that even on today’s grid and with full lifetime manufacturing and disposal emissions taken into consideration EVs are still about twice as clean to create, operate and dispose of than gas vehicles: [http://web.mit.edu/evt/summary\_wtw.pdf](http://web.mit.edu/evt/summary_wtw.pdf)

This one's also pretty good and goes into greater depth concerning the embedded manufacturing emissions for battery packs, and the emissions related to their end of life recycling or disposal: [http://www.triplepundit.com/2011/06/full-life-cycle-assesment-electric-cars-compares-co2-impact-conventional-cars/](http://www.triplepundit.com/2011/06/full-life-cycle-assesment-electric-cars-compares-co2-impact-conventional-cars/)  
Here’s another one which breaks down all the manufacturing emissions by source for both electric and gas powered cars, with some well done graphs: https://www.theicct.org/publications/EV-battery-manufacturing-emissions  
Finally, here's a video debunking claims PragerU has made in the past about the wheel to well lifetime emissions of EVs as compared to gas vehicles. You'll note Lomborg compared manufacturing emissions of EVs vs combustion engine cars, but deliberately neglected to compare lifetime emissions:

<p>This is not to say that EVs aren&#39;t an improvement. Simply that all this justification about how much better they are is glass half full analysis.</p>

You cant convert any car to a system like this as the combustion temperature will be much higher so you will need hardened valves that can take the extra heat.

"My son had a Mk. 1 Focus hatchback (2002) as his first car back in 2012, also with the 1.6 litre petrol engine.  Zetec trim.  I really liked it; it was spacious, practical, economical to run, has a good suspension setup so it's fun to drive down twisty back roads, and that 1.6 has a decent amount of low-end power - it accelerated well from a standing start, and you really only felt a lack of power when trying to overtake on a motorway (70 MPH).  It's a fine car - I really like the way the facelifted Mk. 1 Focus looks - it's a good bit of design and in my opinion has aged really well.  You can freshen it up a bit fairly cheaply by replacing halogen bulbs with LEDs (not sure re. legality of doing this on road-going cars in Argentina, though).

Unfortunately, as with all Fords of that era, it suffered badly from rust (particularly a problem here in the UK). He had it for a couple of years before it failed its MOT due to corrosion of the body shell around the seatbelt mount points.  The power steering rack also rusted through and was leaking fluid, and a replacement part would have been uneconomical to obtain.  The speedo also kept dropping to 0 randomly.  We sold the car to someone who wanted the engine for a project.  He then went out and bought a 2000 Toyota Celica 1.8 VVT-i (Gen 7), which was quite fun to drive but not particularly comfortable on longer journeys.

Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) is what CNG is called around here, and it's a fairly common modification.  You can buy LPG at most UK petrol stations.  When I looked into it, a conversion would have cost a couple of thousand pounds - at the time, that was as much as I was able to pay for a whole car, and I'd have needed to cover a whole lot of miles before it would break even.

I hope the economy gets better for you in Argentina.

EDIT:  I forgot to say - cars equipped to run LPG are not permitted on the Eurotunnel trains (the ones that go through the railway tunnel that goes under the English Channel between the UK and France) - I think they had a bad fire there once that was caused by an LPG system.  Anyone considering fitting an LPG conversion needs to be aware of restrictions like this in their area.","<div class=""md""><p>My son had a Mk. 1 Focus hatchback (2002) as his first car back in 2012, also with the 1.6 litre petrol engine.

"It's easier to learn to drive a slow car fast than a fast car fast.  The slow car makes you focus on your entry, trail braking, apex speed, momentum, exit speed, track out, etc.  Everything is at a slower pace too so you can react to it.  Car's like the AP1 have effectively twice the hp of the Miata with roughly the same footprint and a twitchy rear suspension design; they are much harder to learn to drive at 8/10ths or 10/10ths than a Miata.  

Vettes are the same way except you have huge tires and huge torque, but that doesn't help if you can't control it.  You have to actually modulate the throttle carefully as opposed to 'wait wait stomp' in the Miata.

<p>All it needed was a beefier motor, electronic motors at the front wheels. With a non-shit eco mode and a bigger baggage area in the back...and it&#39;d of sold like fucking french fries at a McDonalds. </p>

<p>We essentially need someone to make the BRZ/FRS/86 of the hybrid market. Honda was so god damn close...and fucked it all up. </p>

<p>EDIT: Note - they also could of figured out how to mate the supercharger to the CR-Z from HPD for less than 40 grand and not waste all that R&amp;D time. </p>

"From the various articles I've read, it seems they've used the supercharger to provide about 7 PSI of boost, but mainly it's there to run crazy high A/F ratios (over 30:1) at partial throttle, and really get the air swirling into the cylinder to mix the fuel more effectively for compression ignition.

I'm guessing they can't just turn up the boost to make more power, at least not without giving up some amount of SPCCI range and efficiency.  It makes me wonder if Mazda will develop a Skyactiv-X V6 for their larger cars like the CX-9, which is currently using a turbo 4-cylinder, or if they're indeed able to push the 4-cylinder Skyactiv-X harder.","<div class=""md""><p>From the various articles I&#39;ve read, it seems they&#39;ve used the supercharger to provide about 7 PSI of boost, but mainly it&#39;s there to run crazy high A/F ratios (over 30:1) at partial throttle, and really get the air swirling into the cylinder to mix the fuel more effectively for compression ignition.</p>

"Every Mazda I drove has a terrible sounding engine. I doubt the extreme focus on MPG will make it all that good as a fun engine, as impressive as it is.

They are excellent all around cars and I think they'll continue to sell well.

Mazda does lack any electrification in their lineup. Instead they spent the money on this engine technology, which really sounds like the strategy Ford used with the ecoboost a decade ago. With most other automakers moving toward hybrids and EVs, I wonder if it'll work out all that well.

"Break out the way-back machine - in the oil crisis in the early 1970s, where gas stations were running out of fuel to sell, there was gas rationing and lines miles long waiting to fuel. 

Of course people started carrying extra gas in the trunks of their cars to ensure they weren't left walking due to no gas being available. They used whatever containers they could as the 'real' gas cans sold out quick. Cue the spike in nasty accidents involving fire and deaths/burns due to fuel spilling all over where there would normally be none.

Can't find the videos showing what happens when you get slammed in the back while carrying extra gas in the trunk but rest assured it is not a good situation. Fire everywhere basically, and many spills within the vehicle which made it almost impossible to drive after cleaning out the spilled gasoline due to the fumes.

If you must carry spare fuel, do so in containers designed for this purpose and secure these containers (in the shade) so they stay put during a roll-over or other accident.","<div class=""md""><p>Break out the way-back machine - in the oil crisis in the early 1970s, where gas stations were running out of fuel to sell, there was gas rationing and lines miles long waiting to fuel. </p>

I have a nagging feeling that I'd also be perfectly happy with a Peugeot 205 or 106 Rallye.

<p>I can think of two cars I&#39;d drive in unmodified form and be perfectly happy, based on a few miles: the Lotus Elan S1-S4 (I would swap the rotoflexes for CVs) and the Carrera RS 2.7 Lightweight (I&#39;d run spacers with 6s and 7s so they fit better and would probably do some foam work to the seats because I&#39;m a bigger guy than most Germans in the &#39;70s). I have a nagging feeling that I&#39;d also be perfectly happy with a Peugeot 205 or 106 Rallye.</p>

<p>Otherwise... modify all the things, but do it holistically. As I&#39;ve grown older, I&#39;ve realized exactly what I&#39;m looking for and will laser-focus all mods on that particular thing.</p>

Entirely depends on what stage electric cars were at during this 'discovery point.' 

If we were at 150 mile range with a 16 hour charging time then yes gas would be a 'breakthrough.'

Cost is probably number one reason. Hybrid gas makes sense to completely turn off the gas engine to be efficient but diesels to be efficient want to utilize low end torque and run at low RPMs for a long period of time. You would get an advantage from the hybrid but not the same percentage of advantage that gas would. Also diesel emissions are bad when not operating at temperature and would likely produce more emissions for some drive cycle cases. However with that said a decoupled hybrid vehicle where the electric motors are the only source of propulsion could probably benefit from a diesel engine as range extender.,"<div class=""md""><p>Cost is probably number one reason.

"The way something like the Toyota hybrids work is that they keep the gasoline engine right at the most efficient spot possible and they tune the engine to be extremely efficient in the region of operation that the hybrid system will operate it at.

At low load and idle for example the engine is completely turned off. Gasoline engines are garbage for efficiency at low load compared to diesel but this advantage wouldn't be noticed in a hybrid.

At loads that are low but not low enough to run purely on electric, Toyota uses the starter/generator ""MG1"" as a brake on the engine to reduce RPMs. Then it can run closer to that efficiency sweet spot of high load at around 2000-2500 RPM because the engine generates less torque at 1500 RPM WOT than 2500 RPM WOT, but it's still near full throttle anyways. The extra energy that is captured from MG1 is sent to the drive wheel motors, MG2. A diesel would see some benefit but not a ton.

As load is increased the ICE ends up at WOT at the ideal sweet spot. The hybrid system basically does nothing here because it's as efficient as it gets. Diesel wouldn't benefit at all.

As you request more power than the ICE can deliver efficiently the electric motors begin providing assist. If you ask for even more power than the motors + efficient ICE can provide then the ICE RPM is increased to peak power and held there with MG1 and max assist from MG2.

So if you think through all of these things a traditional hybrid doesn't make a ton of sense on a diesel engine. They don't suffer quite as much efficiency loss as gas engines in normal driving so really all that's left is maybe a 10% improvement in BSFC for maybe 5000 USD more in MSRP.

Diesels, like any combustion engine, are limited in their torque and power output by the amount of fuel that they can burn cleanly. For a naturally aspirated diesel that's not much because even at wide open 'throttle' they still need to run very lean.

You could actually increase the output of a naturally aspirated diesel by just increasing the injection amount, but you quickly run into problems with visible black smoke and high combustion/exhaust temperatures.

"this is why diesels aren't a thing in america, you described it perfectly.

Here in (my part of) Europe, things are different. diesel is cheaper than gasoline. So already a huge benefit. Then, once you get to smaller (""smaller"", as in 1.6, 1.8, 2.0) displacements, diesels use ridiculously little fuel for the power and torque they make. My girlfriend averages a bit below 5L/100km (47ish US MPG) in her new 2.0 TDI golf. Sure it only makes 110 horsepower but it makes 183 lb ft of torque way down low. And there's a 2.0 that comes tuned to 150 horsepower and over 236 lb ft in the BlueMotion, and probably still gets very good mileage. 

For comparison, the only petrol engines I'm familiar with that gets those numbers are the tiny 1.0 3 cylinders like in the fiesta ecoboost or the Twingo with really no torque to speak of. 

Then there's the subsidies farmers get. You can write off tax off of diesel if it's for ""work equipment"". Since your car gets you to work, bam, no tax on diesel.  Of course not if you're not a farmer but if you are, you *will* drive a diesel car because of this. 

Maintenance also isn't a problem because diesels aren't rare. Yes they still cost more off the dealership lot, but you won't pay significantly more over a petrol car for upkeep. In fact, considering pretty much all diesels are turbocharged now, you're paying less than you would to maintain a turbo petrol car.

"You missed the most important piece to diesels in the United States.

Towing.

An Ecoboost when towing and going up a hill will sit around 4-5k RPM and make a hell of a noise. Also, the truck will be dumping extra fuel into the engine (rich mixture) to keep it cool. That means it'll make 250-350hp continually, but the mpg will drop significantly. You won't see that 26mpg highway. More like 13-18. Also, if you have a heavy foot, forget that 26mpg. It'll be much lower, likely less than 20.

Contrast that to a diesel that makes most of it's torque at low rpm. Going up a hill, it'll make a loud noise but not the 4-5k rpm noise, because it'll be running around 2k rpm. Also, it won't lose it's mpg under load like an ecoboost will. So towing, you'll still get 22-24 mpg while the ecoboost will be stuck in the mid 10s.

"I had a VW Golf TDI and I’ll never buy another diesel

* Diesel fuel costs more, enough more that the mpg improvements over gasoline are completely nullified by the increased price per gallon

* Diesel engine option is like $3,000

* The engine parts are more expensive because they have lower production volumes and are made only for that engine

* Diesel mechanics are far fewer, so you have to drive to the other side of the city to get one and they charge a far higher hourly rate

* Short trips are hard on diesel engines

* When the emissions equipment reaches 100,000 miles, you have to fork out $3,000 to replace it,

Here’s where diesels make sense:

* You’re hauling heavy loads every day

* You have to leave the vehicle idling for most of the work day

* Government regulations force the market into diesels, like has happened in Europe. That said, I think diesel is taxed higher than gas in USA, but not nearly to the extent that European regulations are biased against gasoline.

"Diesel engines often have much further ranges compared to gas cars. For example some diesels like in the Mercedes ML350 (now GLE) can have ranges as far as 700 miles. There have even been some TDI Passats that have gone 1,100 miles on a single tank. 

My mom had a ML350 BlueTec V6 that was a phenomenal vehicle. I was able to drive it from Los Angeles to Las Vegas and easily achieved 30-32 mpg going 85 mph. 1 tank lasted to and from Las Vegas which was impressive. Although, in typical Mercedes fashion, it decided to make ticking bomb noises from the hood and transmission issues so it was re-purchased from the dealer under the lemon law.

"I rebuilt a 94 CB1000 this summer that had sat for seven years with a full tank of gas.  The person I bought it from said that he had added Sta-Bil when he parked it, but the whole fuel system was a mess.

The E10 gas used in my region had pulled in water and, despite being full of ""gas,"" the inside of the tank was coated with rust.  So much so that I had to send it out to be treated and lined.  When I drained the fuel it came out brown and smelled like varnish.  The petcock was destroyed and the plastic fuel filter/inlet was so gummed up with varnish that it fell apart when I touched it.

I replaced all the lines, added an in-line filter, I also rebuilt and re-jetted all four carbs.  For the most part, what I found in the bowls were not too bad.  My guess is that the fuel in them evaporated pretty early on, but one carb did required a new pilot valve.  Once I got everything running, I put some Berryman's B12 Chemtool through the gas tank (along with fresh gas) and everything seems to work fine.

So, honestly, I'm not sure where I come down on additives.  The video Geminile added in their own post does a good job of explaining what they do but if I ever leave mine sit for more than a few months, I think I will just use as much gas as I can and then drain what is left over.  I'll also drain the bowls on the carbs.  Seems like the best way to go.","<div class=""md""><p>I rebuilt a 94 CB1000 this summer that had sat for seven years with a full tank of gas.

I wonder if they did pulse and glide to try and extract more fuel economy. I'm guessing the answer is probably no. I've gotten 70 mpg out of a Prius before when the stars align for pulsing and gliding on expressways while hitting speeds of 50-60 mph which was speed of traffic. Accelerating in the BSFC sweet spot and gliding with preferably only air/rolling resistance really does make a noticeable difference in fuel economy if you can pull it off.,"<div class=""md""><p>I wonder if they did pulse and glide to try and extract more fuel economy.

"It is possible, but as mentioned most tend to go with propane when converting to a gaseous combustion fuel. There are some off-road guys and even a fair amount of commercial fleet vehicles that do it for various reasons (angularity issues, emissions, better engine wear characteristics, etc). There are some full kits for propane or CNG conversion for certain engines, though I don't think I've seen pre-made kits for H2. It may be as simple as swapping a H2 specific regulator to a propane/CNG kit, but I'm not certain.

On older engines, you can replace the carburetor with a special mixing hat, which is a kind of regulator and air/fuel mixing valve combination. On newer vehicles you can adapt specialized gaseous fuel injectors to replace the liquid fuel ones, though I think some individuals have gone with a injector plate behind the throttle-body. Both obviously require an entire new fuel system centered around compressed gas as fuel.

While going to a gaseous fuel does have benefits such as elimination of fuel-washing of the cylinders and oil contamination with gasoline, both leading to a much longer wearing engine, it's still a pricey modification (and will obviously void any warranties and wreak havoc with emissions inspections, if applicable to your vehicle/area). Also as mentioned, it does come with a drop in power, approximately an 20% loss, and is not as cheap or convenient to refill as gasoline or diesel (though I realize the question is posed if that changes).

The biggest giveaway if the engine is lugging is adding more throttle makes the car louder but doesn&#39;t make the car speed up.</p>

"In extreme cases of lugging, you will feel a very harsh vibration from the engine, and it will struggle to accelerate like you said. Not that I'd recommend testing it, but if you did try to drive up an incline in too high a gear and floor it, it would be immediately obvious. 

&#x200B;

>often in a 30 kph zone I let the car cruise at 3rd gear (30 kph is \~1500 RPM at 3rd gear) ... keeps rolling at idle RPM to turn (\~15-20 kph), then slowly accelerate back up a little bit

Keep in mind that I am speaking without knowing the specifics of your gear ratios or the engine's power and torque band. 

I'd say accelerating from idle in 3rd would be coming close to lugging the engine, if not already doing so. You seem to be getting away with it on your local flat roads and with light throttle usage, but that humming you described might be minor lugging, especially at that low an RPM in 5th gear.

Going back to your example though, compared with going down to 2nd, by remaining in 3rd and accelerating from near idle you are at a mechanical disadvantage, which will encourage lugging. The lower gear will have a higher torque multiplication effect, which will reduce the effort needed by the engine to accelerate the car. 

In the lower gear you will also obviously be higher up in the RPM range. For a naturally aspirated engine like yours, this will usually mean a higher engine torque and power output (to a point), making acceleration easier still and avoiding lugging. 

&#x200B;

If I were you, I'd definitely try to keep those revs up if you need to accelerate. It might not be lugging or bogging down, but it won't be too happy either to be straining and pulling the car along from such a low RPM. It will not have much torque to work with down low and in a higher gear.","<div class=""md""><p>In extreme cases of lugging, you will feel a very harsh vibration from the engine, and it will struggle to accelerate like you said.

"Been driving a manual all my life in Europe.

The rule of thumb would be that while the engine is cold you should not over rev it (maybe keep it below 50-60% of the max RPMs it can achieve) and once it gets warmer all the RPMs should be available and used when needed. 

My advice would be to keep your rpm > 1700 RPM no matter what you might get as recommendation and so on to have better flow of oil and engine health. I usually shift at around 3500+ RPM (depending on car it could be higher RPMs) and only cruise on flat roads at lower RPM (e.g. you accelerate from a stand still up to 50 Kph - normally in 2nd or 3rd - and you can cruise in a higher gear than normal - could be 4th or 5th to keep RPMs > 1700RPM). 

Low and very low RPMs and accelerating while in high gear would definitely hurt your engine in the long run due bad lubrication and so on.","<div class=""md""><p>Been driving a manual all my life in Europe.</p>

"For your car, anything below 1800 rpm is probably lugging the engine. Accelerating in third gear at 20kph is most definitely lugging the engine. I wouldn't shift into 3rd gear under 40 kph, maybe 35kph if you're on a straight road or going downhill.

Stuttering and vibrations similar to stalling happen when you're lugging the engine so much that it's close to dying. In real life, few people get to such an extreme. Most lugging occurs when the engine is working normally, but it's not in its ideal power range because revs are too low for the gear you're in.

Based on your description, it sounds like you're constantly lugging the engine. Which is not bad for fuel economy.

"Driving with high revs being torturing the engine is kind of a weird sentiment that drivers ed teachers and non-car people tend to have (certainly did have in the past), especially in Europe. This may be compounded by the issue that most sensible small car I4s really make an awful racket at higher revs, while still not moving that much faster. 

In driver's ed we had small diesels and gasoline engines, I was taught to never rev above 2000 rpm, just find an appropriate gear (even when driving up a hill). In city driving I was taught to drive with 4th gear at 30mph, staying about 200 revs above lugging and stalling the engine.  My mom was also taught the same 15 years prior and honestly considered revving above 2000 bad for the engine (even on a warm engine, no matter if a diesel or a gasoline). I did not get rid of that faulty mindset until I bought an American V8 as my second car and finally found out that revving a warm engine to the limiter is not something to be afraid of.","<div class=""md""><p>Driving with high revs being torturing the engine is kind of a weird sentiment that drivers ed teachers and non-car people tend to have (certainly did have in the past), especially in Europe.
