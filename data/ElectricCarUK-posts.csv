So I made a native iOS app that does exactly that, and also shows your electricity consumption per day and per hour for the past 30 days without having to wait for the bill to be issued. By checking the rolling 30 days costs you can tell whether you're spending more or less.

I thought I'd share the link here in case any other Octopus customers fancy giving it a spin. It's free for now, but I was thinking to put it at £0.99 in a month or two.

Also - in regards to the credentials, the app doesn't store or send your octopus credentials anywhere, it logs in in the background, gathers your API key (you need to generate it before using the app), your MPAN and serial number, and then stores those values instead.

&#x200B;

Passed my driving test yesterday and am trying to work out the best thing to do but...lack of experience, y'know?  


My initial thought was plug in hybrid, but considering the government's stance on phasing out petrol/diesel new purchases I didn't know if it was prudent to just go all in on Electric. I've been eyeing up the Nissan Leaf (2017 model, not E+). There's a couple of things holding me back though:  


1) No personal charging point - Live in a block of flats without a personal charging point, though the supermarket next door and my work place both have charging points so I guess it isn't a massive issue? Have any of you been in this situation?  


2) Friends in distant lands - I have close friends up in Newcastle (I'm in the south so roughly 300 miles) so would be using that car to visit them. I'm assuming this would be a charge at the half way mark for an hour or two. It wouldn't be every weekend but I wouldn't want it to hamper me if I did want to visit them over the quick-fill of a plug in hybrid. Does anyone make long distance journeys on the regular?   


3) Journeys abroad - I have a big grand plan to drive over to Bled in Slovenia, but the fear that I won't be able to charge the car is worrying. I understand that it's not built for those kinds of journeys so it would need to be a ""Drive 200 miles, charge, relax in some town somewhere, drive another hundred, sleep for the night, drive another hundred in the AM, charge and relax for lunch, etc"" scenario, but if anyone has experience on major road trips and foreign charging that'd be good just so that I know what to expect.  


4) mains charging - am I right in assuming most electrics can charge off generic three pin plugs? So if I, say, visited family 100 miles away I could sling a cable inside and charge up while I visit them and then drive home end of day okay without having to hit up a specific charging points?   


5) With public EV charging points (as in on [https://www.zap-map.com/live/](https://www.zap-map.com/live/)) does the network matter? Is it just the connection you have to worry about? How panicky do you have to get when you hit 25% power when it comes to looking at the map and trying to marry up your car's connection to nearby points?

&#x200B;

I'm sorry if a lot of this has been answered elsewhere, I'm just not in the know about cars in general and don't want to mess this up. I'm spending time looking for answers, but anecdotal information allows me to also go and look up specific things as well and increase my base knowledge of electric cars.

I am hoping to benefit from your experience.  My last 2 cars have been plug in hybrids but now I am looking to go fully electric.

90% of my driving is short journeys - max 50 miles each way at weekends.

However, occasionally we travel London to Edinburgh or down to France.  

The question mark I have right now is how feasible is it?  I am sure I can plan sensible stops etc but what are people's experiences of finding charging points etc?

I am looking at cars with claimed ranges of over 200 miles - just for info.

We don't have any NEED for a car. We live in Cambridge and have got by fine on foot and bike for many years. The purpose would primarily be to explore further afield (within ~90 mile radius, to places where we can't easily/affordably get by train).

Budget is £550/mth, plus charge cost.

Can't charge at home because no off-street parking and can't always be monitoring the cable on the footpath. However, there appear to be numerous chargers nearby us, within 15 minute walk (ranging from 5-15minute walk, maybe a dozen devices with 2 or more chargers).

Our usage pattern will likely be longer weekend journeys, up to 90 miles, 180 return, and let's say 1-2 additional journeys of 5 miles or less per week.

Had been looking at Onto a few mths ago, but now I see they've failed. Elmo and Ezoo stick out as alternatives, but the lack of the charge card on these services (whereas onto provided a card that worked with a nearby charging device) means more cost risk to me. I'm only slightly concerned about the charging cost; more concerned about the uncertainty of that cost.

The other uncertainty for me is damage fees. I have third party excess insurance. I had learned that Onto worked by 28 day contracts meaning it sat within the third party excess policy limits of max 28 day hires. I don't know about how other subscription companies work. I am hugely concerned about the uncertainty brought by any damage claims, and want to be confident that any insurance claims will be covered. I acknowledge this concern might be outside the interests of this sub, but putting it out there anyways, in case there's experience and insight to share.

With their environmental benefits, reduced operating costs, and impressive performance, it's no wonder that EVs are gaining traction worldwide. Yet, at the heart of every electric car's capabilities lies a silent hero – the Battery Management System (BMS).

 EVs are only as good as their batteries, and the BMS is responsible for ensuring that these batteries have long and healthy lives. It continuously monitors and manages the state of charge, temperature, and voltage of individual cells within the battery pack. By preventing overcharging, over-discharging, and keeping the battery within an optimal temperature range, the BMS extends the battery's lifespan, reducing the need for premature replacements.

Has any changed or concerned the change from a full EV to a Hybrid.

I’m having these thoughts as I have had an ev (e-208) for 3 years and over the passed 6-8 months I have found it increasingly difficult to change at chargers on the motorways as there tends to be long ques.

My thinking is that since is not often I do more than 30 miles in a day and I have a charger at home I could get something like the Peugeot 408 hybrid and be filling electric most of the time but when ever I choose to make a long drive I would have the back up of an IC engine.

I guess the other option is to look at long range vehicles since my current ev is advertised at 200 and I’m not seeing cars such as the facelift model 3 with up to 425mils but I’m not sure the extra prices if worth it if I’m only doing long drives every couple of months.

I  would love to buy a fully electric car but it would definitely need to be second hand due to cost. I would also like it to be long lasting, changing cars regularly is not an option for us. We are a family of 5 and currently drive an SUV 7 seater. We generally use the car for local journeys, occ longer journeys at weekends. 
I am really undecided if a plug in hybrid or electric is the way to go. Or if second hand for electric cars is wise. What will be useful for the longest period of time  (will only electric be allowed in London over the next 10 years for example?). Should I go fully electric with young kids (slightly worried I might need to stop and charge, with young kids, this would be a pain)? 
It's not long to go until the new ULEZ rules come into place and would really appreciate any advice or opinion on the best way to go.",None,None,Advice needed for family of 5.,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/ElectricCarUK/comments/14181wm/advice_needed_for_family_of_5/

I've just bought a Nero First Edition, it's lovely and drives really well, I'm so happy with the driving. I'm not so happy with the satnav and 'infotainment' system. I have run into a couple of places where the road layout has changed and the car doesn't know. A big roundabout in Bristol that has been removed and an annoying but funny incident where it directed me into the Westfield car park thinking I could get to the A40.

I wonder if I can update the maps and while I'm at it, can I install the Kia Connect app? Is this something I can do myself or do I need to visit a Kia dealership?
