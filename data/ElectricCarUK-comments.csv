"No experience with EV, but I am thinking about it for my next car. My commute is a 32 mile round trip. I can go on an A road most of the way, but I prefer the scenic route along B roads, through towns and villages. Plus, the company I work for have installed 3 EV charge points in the company car park!

I've pretty much dismissed anything described as  a town car (e.g. electric mini, etc).

Have you considered Kia's range?

* E-Soul - looks fugly though
* E-Niro - good reviews, often in comparison to the Kona. Getting them is like hen's teeth apparently.

I have a petrol Kia Cee'd currently, and they do a 7-year warranty on all their cars. Probably not so much of a worry if you're going to lease or use PCP.

"I do 60 miles a day 5 days a week and obviously use it to anywhere outside of work because it’s so cheap to run, I also charge at work for free. In my old Kia Soul EV I had a 20k a year contract and was going to burn past the 60k over 3 years until the pandemic last March and lockdown saved me so much in excess mileage charges. 
My new car is an MG MG5 on 25k a year over 4 years and that’s £338 a month with no initial lease. It’s quoted range is 213 miles but with motorway driving at 70mph I am fine if this is reduced to 180 as that is still plenty to get to the mother in law’s and back without charging. 
Now my life story is over, I looked at all those cars and with the government grant reducing to £2.5k in March, the prices all went up and the price sky rockets on a lease over 15-20k miles a year. The quoted prices on all the websites is usually 8k miles a year, I could not find a Kona, ID3 or my preferred eNiro for the price of the MG. 
If you have £2k initial rental to put down then it might be affordable but that initial cost and a monthly of £350 will cost a lot over 3-4 years. The effective monthly would be about £400 over the course of the lease. 
I wanted a bigger boot hence why I looked at the eNiro/Kona, and settled on the MG5 because it’s an estate. The roof rails on the Exclusive are decorative only, despite initial MG pictures from the company themselves showing roof boxes and bike racks on the bars, since airbrushed out - so I don’t know what ownership is going to be like at this point. 
You probably got your Leaf at a similar time to my Soul, back in 2017/18 when there were huge discounts from the only 2 electric cars around. Those discounts are gone so my monthly on the Soul was £250 for 20k a year, unbelievable price for that mileage. Mechanically absolutely nothing went wrong with the car apart from the 12v battery had to be replaced. That was a reliable Kia though, again no idea what the MG will be like, but with so few moving parts I don’t bother with a maintenance contract as that adds such a premium to the monthly price. 
There was only one spec on the Soul so it was a superbly equipped car and it might be worth stretching your budget for the extras that now cost extra.
Best wishes with whatever you choose though!","<div class=""md""><p>I do 60 miles a day 5 days a week and obviously use it to anywhere outside of work because it’s so cheap to run, I also charge at work for free.

I agree with other comments that not having home charging will make EV ownership quite burdensome.

If you’re good at planning (so you’re not running out of charge on a regular basis) and are extremely keen on EVs then it is still worth it (EVs are awesome). But… it could wear thin pretty quick.

You didn’t ask for advice on the ranges but personally regular trips to Scotland or London I would be looking at an eNiro or Kona, which claim to touch 300m and don’t have tiny boots like the electric Corsa or e Peugeot, which claim just over 200 miles a full charge.

"Nothing on EON page about having to have a wall charger.

I'm sure you will appreciate a wall box.

Whilst you would get-a-way with  the standard 3 pin granny charger, you wont be able to fully charge the car in one night (2.5kw x 7hr = 17.5kWh - less than half your battery capacity). 

I expect your qualified-electrician dad will warn of the load you'd be putting on house wiring by pulling 2.5kw continuously for 7 hours.

I get 4.2 miles/kwh  from my i3, so the granny charger adds about 8 miles range in an hour, the wallbox adds 30 miles range in an hour and its not unusual for me to come home from work and want to fill up the battery for an evening outing.

Callboxes, especially Zappi, come with ""smart"" features, internet connectivity, reporting and so on which you may also find useful.

If I had a family member as an electrician, it would be even more of a no-brainer to fit a fast home charger 7.5kW.

Charging without a charger was a huge pain though. Maps showed several chargers near me but there were only 2 that worked within about 20 miles from home. Work paid for all charging on mine but charging point tariffs are very expensive.

"We don't really know. Realistically you might be able to get it replaced in 15-20 years to breathe fresh life into the cars range. Or like in the case of some old Kia Soul EVs just replacing a couple of modules (costs a few hundred bucks, got most range back)

EVs are designed with certain sized battery packs, weighing X kilos etc. So any ""upgrade"" or otherwise replacement has to play well with those specifications.

But again we just don't know. No EV's of modern design have been around for so long, except leaf. And those early tesla owners from back in the day are probably rich enough to buy a new car every few years.","<div class=""md""><p>We don&#39;t really know.
