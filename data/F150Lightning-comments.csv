So, with the help of a ratchet strap and some trail fix thinking… the CT was able to drive under its own power slowly out of the desert back to camp.

JoeDimwit,"Boy have I got opinions on this. Firstly, none of what I am about to say is directed at any one individual person. 

Anyone expecting free charging at work is delusional. Are there places that do it? Sure. The first year I had my Mach-E I was able and encouraged to charge at work. I drove 25,000 miles that year with a total fuel cost of $0.00. It was awesome. But, the minute the situation changed and I couldn’t do it anymore, I simply started using my home level 2 charger. My company is talking about installing charging stations in the parking lots, and I have suggested to them that free use isn’t the way to go. It would eventually get out on PlugShare and people from the surrounding area would tie them up. I also suggested that a different way to combat that, along with lower the costs of installation, would be to make the chargers level 1 only. 

On the other hand, even level 2 charging for me would cost less than $3.00/day. That’s less waste than a 10 minute smoke break twice a day. Also, my (large manufacturing company) employer has made quite a bit of press out of putting the largest living roof in the USA (at the time) on one of their factories, and they could garner even more positive press out of a campaign like this.","<div class=""md""><p>Boy have I got opinions on this.

All of them had a broken card reader and a bad EA member tap area. Tried to activate the charger via the EA app and it said I was already charging. It’s a 50/50 shot every time I come to one of there chargers. I have yet to come across a Tesla charger that hasn’t worked. I still plan to buy the lightning as I just love the truck but am nervous of the future EA problems I will probably experience down the road.,"<div class=""md""><p>I do not own a Lightning but do plan on buying one in the very near future.

Sestos,"Was a good article about this but I forget who published it, was NPR or VICE. 

Issue with adding chargers, solar fields, wind etc.. is that the currently network cannot support it. Lots of projects are held up or waiting for someone else to pay for upgrades. So someone wants to add a solar farm.. they have to submit paperwork for approval. The utility then looks at the power network to see if the lines etc.. can take the additional power. If they cannot, then the utility sends the quote to upgrade the network to the company trying to add solar or wind farm. In most cases, the cost is huge to replace miles or lines and network. 

Not many states allow stuff to tie into the grid and throttle them if they start to overload it, most are setup to require upgrades before hand. But even in the situation where it can be throttled. You now have something producing say X KW's but really can push half of it to the grid. 

Nationwide need infrastructure improvement to the power grids.","<div class=""md""><p>Was a good article about this but I forget who published it, was NPR or VICE. </p>

Consistent-Chapter-8,"EA is the worst charging network in North America. Volkswagen's penance for Dieselgate. Take a bow, VW!

Tesla took building out a supercharger network seriously, & unless other automakers make their own (serious) efforts at network buildout, TSLA's first mover advantage appears insurmountable.

\[Full disclosure: I have a position in TSLA\]

Along with network size, Tesla's network uptime is the other marked difference with other charging providers. You haven't lived until you've experienced the frustration of limping to a charging station & \*none\* of the charging stalls work. I was renting a KIA EV at the time, & had to resort to Level 2 charging. Made it home w/less than 10 miles state of charge remaining. That was a long day.

Once I was able to buy an EV of my own, getting a Tesla was a no brainer. (If you can rely on charging at home, you can get nearly any brand of EV that has sufficient range, but if not, that's when Supercharging access stands out.) Indifferent (or user hostile) networks like EA that don't care about network uptime are hampering EV adoption.","<div class=""md""><p>EA is the worst charging network in North America.

Think-Work1411,"Do you know why Electrify America is so bad? It’s because they are being forced to build out a charging network as a result of the Volkswagen Diesel emission scandal. Apparently the government did. Include the verbiage “Build out AND MAINTAIN an EV Charging network” so they built it out a charging network as the terms required and they have been reluctant to spend any more money to maintain it. So ask your government that is pushing EVs why the two major charging networks are built out against their will? That’s not the best way to do nature a seamless EV transition. I also take issue with Ford for bragging about their partnership with Electrify America when I’m fact most stations charge at half their rated capacity or less. I’m their defense it wasn’t like that 6 months ago when I bought my Lightning. And our government is so stupid they have decided to measure how reliable charging stations are by verifying the computers in the charging stations ping. So the cables can be cut by vandals, or  the station can be charging at 1% of capacity and the government considers it good. Maybe one day they’ll learn to count charging sessions lasting over 5 mins and actual kilowatt usage of stations as metrics that they are working. Oh and don’t forget, a lot of these stations that are charging at reduced rates are because the electric company doesn’t have the capacity. Your government doesn’t want you to know that, they want us to keep buying EVs expecting the electric grid and charging companies to keep pace with it. But surprise, that’s not happening. So be careful in long trips, don’t show up at a charging station on 5% battery expecting it to work","<div class=""md""><p>Do you know why Electrify America is so bad?

Additionally, you’re not really being green at all. Mainly because the oil companies lobby against nuclear energy daily. I mean come on. The excavators burn 1000s of gallons of fuel a day.

On top of that, you’re burning “fossil fuels” to run the power plants ti make the electric to charge the cars. 

At least make modern nuclear facilities to make the electric that will charge the cars.

shearblack,Will there be enough superchargers once NACS is the norm?  As a Tesla owner I am doubtful.  I hear Tesla sales are currently way outstripping supercharger expansion and currently holiday travel can already be a major backup at many supercharger locations.  Where I live superchargers are already in short supply with wait times many evenings due to Tesla owners that don't have home charging (condo/apartment dwellers). I think it is likely that the worst is yet to come!,"<div class=""md""><p>Will there be enough superchargers once NACS is the norm?  As a Tesla owner I am doubtful.

Golf-Guns,"If by Newark , do you happen to mean Jersey Gardens Mall?

Because I was on a work trip (just got back yesterday) and Hertz apparently is converting their fleet at EWR to mostly EVs.

What a fucking nightmare though. Huge lines to wait in because the chargers are constantly full. Like you said, they seem very glitchy. 

Thursday night there was someone having issues with charger 1 and I watched him sit there for 20 minutes fucking with it and couldn't get it. After he switched it was still 2nd in line and asked the guy who was #1 if I could go try it. Pulled up and got it after about 5 minutes of fucking with it. 

With that, there was one with a screen not working, another not working at all, that one, and an asshole Mercedes just parking there. Prior days I tried to charge the was some company there just circling cars through constantly like they owned the fucking things.

**2023 F150 Lightning Lariat ER**

* **MSRP:** $79,785
* **Selling Price:** $69,965
* **Rebates:** $13,250
* **POS Tax credit:** $7,500
* **Selling price after rebates and credits:** $49,215
* **Balloon Loan with FNYCU (administered by AFG):** $242/month

**WTF is this deal?**

* Easy. Dealership advertised discount online and they honored it. Everything else is me stacking rebates.

**WTF is $13,250 in rebates?**

* $7,500 Rebate Cash from Ford
* $3,750 AZXD Plan Rebate Cash for using X-Plan
* $2,000 Private Offer sent to me via email from Ford

**WTF is a Balloon Loan?**

* It's sort of like a lease but you own the car. You can either choose to return the car or buy it out at the residual price at the end of the term. A few CUs in the country do this program. I used [First New York FCU](https://secure.autofinancialgroup.com/AFG/index.jsp?CUID=221379785&m=&utm_source=website&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=easydrive_rates_yourpayment). I did this because I am allowed to return the vehicle at the residual price ($50k) and all I am paying is interest for 2 years. This is only to protect myself againt any further depreciation.

**I don't believe you, show me the sheet.**

* [Here you go](https://ptpimg.me/0h3ltz.jpg)

The $7500 POS rebate is show as a down payment. Thats how that credit is applied.

**$5597 in TAXES HOLY SHIT??**

* Yea I live in NY, thanks.

PedalingHertz,"This is killing me. I passed on my Lightning reservation bc the Silverado EV addressed its shortcomings and they were priced close enough at the time. But the Lightning’s shortcomings aren’t really that bad, I just prefer the longer range and higher charging speeds for the long-range towing I do at least once a year and at most twice.

Seeing the price drop on the Lightning as the Silverado predicted consumer price has climbed has me wondering if I should just buy one now, wait another year to get my preferred Silverado at a far higher price, or wait even longer to see if Silverado prices drop by the same amount (they probably will).

https://electrek.co/2024/02/20/ford-slashes-prices-2023-mustang-mach-e-incentives-for-f-150-lightning/

In addition to the lower prices of the Mustang Mach-E, Ford followed up with additional news this morning, sharing it has also added new bonus cash incentives for certain trims of the 2023 F-150 Lightning.
The Lariat, XLT, and Pro versions of the 2023 Lightning currently qualify for a $7,500 retail credit for eligible customers at the point of sale. Still, Ford has added additional bonuses as follows:
$7,500 retail bonus cash on an F-150 XLT Extended Range purchase
$5,000 retail bonus cash on F-150 Lightning Lariat Standard and Extended Range purchase
$12,500 retail bonus cash for the F-150 Lightning Platinum
If US consumers would prefer instead to pursue a lease of a 2023 F-150 Lightning, Ford has added some new offers to help sweeten the deal:
$1,500 red carpet lease cash for the XLT
$5,000 red carpet lease cash on the Lariat

furiouschads,"I had a hard time getting a PRO. 

I ordered one when the order banks opened up in August 2023. They didn't schedule it for production. I heard that Ford was not scheduling Pros for December or January. 

So I bought one from dealer stock at the end of November for MSRP. After the tax credit, the ""MSRP"" was $42,495.  I'm happy with that price.

I worked with two dealers. One was my small town dealer in WNC who was not at all interested.  I bought from a Baltimore-area dealer who was enthusiastic.

**Ford should produce a lot of Pros to get them on the street.** Every one that goes into service will create two or three new sales.  People are interested when I pull up at the grocery store or Lowes/HD and open the frunk.","<div class=""md""><p>I had a hard time getting a PRO. </p>

Emlerith,"SYAC / Ad Block:  


 **Ford Motor Co.** plans to cut output of its electric F-150 Lightning pickup by half next year because of ""changing market demand,"" a steep pullback of a high-profile nameplate the automaker spent most of this year working to build in larger numbers.

According to a planning memo obtained by *Automotive News*, Ford has told suppliers to prepare for average volume of around 1,600 Lightnings a week at its Rouge Electric Vehicle Center in Dearborn, Mich., starting in January. It assembles an average of 3,200 a week today.

Output of gasoline-powered pickups at plants in Michigan and Missouri is expected to be essentially unchanged, the company said in the memo.

Ford didn't respond to a request for comment Monday.

The news comes amid an industrywide pullback in EV investment due to slower-than-expected sales growth. Ford in October temporarily idled one of three shifts at the Lightning plant, affecting about 700 workers.

It added that third shift late last year as part of an effort to triple production to an annual run rate of 150,000 by this fall. To reach that goal, the plant was idled for six weeks in early 2023 as the company made the facility more than 70 percent larger.

""The reality is clear,"" Kumar Galhotra, now Ford's COO, said in January 2022. ""People are ready for an all-electric F-150, and Ford is pulling out all the stops to scale our operations and increase production capacity.""

Recently, though, EV demand has slowed, prompting Ford and other automakers to rethink ambitious production targets.

Ford has delayed roughly $12 billion in EV investments and postponed some production targets. The company has said it was reducing some Mustang Mach-E production and postponing opening one of two battery plants planned in Kentucky with partner SK On.

""The narrative has taken over that EVs aren't growing; they're growing,"" CFO John Lawler said in October while announcing Ford's third-quarter earnings. ""It's just growing at a slower pace than the industry and, quite frankly, we expected.""

Despite the pullback, Lightning sales continue to increase. Ford sold 4,393 of the trucks in November — a monthly record, according to CEO Jim Farley. U.S. sales have jumped 54 percent so far this year.","<div class=""md""><p>SYAC / Ad Block:  </p>

This has never happened with my 2017 Ford Focus electric.

The infotainment system is separate from the propulsion system and the telematics system appears to be 3g only, so it's effectively dead.

Buttons for all HVAC controls, an 8 inch screen for infotainment, and dead nuts reliable propulsion.

Only downside is shit range.

This car would be awesome with minor upgrades:

* 50kwh battery instead of 33.5 kwh

* Aluminum body panels instead of steel

* Heat pump instead of resistive heating

It's go a long way into getting me more than 50 miles of range in the winter and be a perfect city commuter econobox, which is all I need.

Scale up for an F150 and Bob's your auntie.

* No self driving.

* No 20 inch tablet for all center console controls

* No motorized door handles or tailgate

* No massage seats

SilveredFlame,"The good news for you is you should come out ahead financially because you bought about the same time I did when prices were considerably higher.

Check your state's lemon law because that's what Ford will go by when they put together your offer. That will help let you know how much they can deduct from sticker price for mileage, and even that is negotiable.

If you decide to get another Lightning, you should be able to get a pretty nice deal, be able to put a large chunk down given the difference in prices now, and overall come out ahead.

I know it sucks to have this happen, we went through something similar with my wife's Escape PHEV. Ended up picking up a Mach E for her.

ultimaforever,"My home integration install started in July.  They still haven’t got it working.  Ford’s response has been ‘there’s a software update we’re working on to fix it.’  Been months.  Sunrun wants Ford to replace my Pro Charger (they think that’s the issue), but the Ford rep assigned to the case has been ignoring Sunrun.  Thank God they haven’t wanted to examine the truck for weeks on end; sorry to hear about your troubles.  I am however completely unimpressed with how generally ignorant and fragmented support for this home integration thing has been.  Positives are I haven’t paid for it yet, and Sunrun, from what I can see, has done quality work on the install itself and has been trying to keep this moving with Ford.  Ford appears to not have a clue with how to get this fixed, and doesn’t appear to be motivated to move with any urgency or provide proactive updates.  The reps themselves are polite, but it really feels like you’re sucked into a faceless bureaucracy with Ford - few attempts to reach out to you with status, and when they do, it’s to tell you what they can’t do, or that they’re passing the issue off to another group.  One lady, after telling me she was going to close my ticket because there was no firm ETA for the software fix that will supposedly get my home integration system working, then asked me to please fill out the survey I’d be getting soon via email.  Guess this is what I get for jumping in on first gen technology.  Fwiw I love the truck itself, but Ford got over its skis with some of this tech.","<div class=""md""><p>My home integration install started in July.  They still haven’t got it working.

InvestigatorNo4189,"Well, it was quite a journey, but I am happy to report that I was able to purchase and take home my F-150 Lightning from Sunrise Ford in North Hollywood!  Wow!

  
Update regarding original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/F150Lightning/comments/wcujc5/dealership\_refused\_to\_sell\_me\_the\_truck\_i\_ordered/  

  
After being denied the purchase of my ordered Lightning over the weekend, I called Ford Customer Care on Monday to raise hell about what the dealership had done.  Customer Care said they would formally register a complaint about Sunrise Ford and also contact them to try to resolve the situation.  Realistically, there was nothing more they could do, and the woman said I could try to place an order for a new Lightning when the orders open up next month.  She was apologetic even though none of this was her fault, and I was appreciative to hear someone say they were sorry to me.  I then decided to wait and see what would happen after Customer Care contacted Sunrise.

  
On Tuesday, the GM of the dealership called me to discuss the situation.  I won't go into details, but the call did not go well and we resolved nothing; they still wanted me to pay for the dealer add-ons totaling almost $3000.

  
I again called Ford Customer Care that day to update them on my case and to strongly request a call back from someone at Ford Corporate; Customer Care and Corporate are sort of distinct entities.  Customer Care is really limited in what they can do, and they told me that writing a letter to Corporate was my best chance to reach them.  

  
Today, I got an email from the dealership GM asking me what I wanted to do with the truck.  I asked for a complete price summary of the truck, and he sent it over.  Low and behold, the unauthorized dealer add-ons were NOT on my price summary!  My purchase price was MSRP (plus tax and fees)!  A few hours later, I was signing paperwork and driving home with an electric truck!

  
Everyone at the dealership today was friendly and professional.  I don't know if it was Customer Care contacting them, all the negative reviews that I, and dozens of you, posted, but they did a complete 180 and everything went smoothly today.  

  
Thanks for all the support.  I am truly grateful.  But still, direct to consumer is the way to go.

TLDR: I didn't budge and I paid what was right for my truck","<div class=""md""><p>Well, it was quite a journey, but I am happy to report that I was able to purchase and take home my F-150 Lightning from Sunrise Ford in North Hollywood!  Wow!</p>

I doubt they are going to change anything but atleast they will be a dealer to avoid on a lot of people’s list.

Somebody emailed the manager asking about it and this is the shit they send

>	He didn't say the whole story. We were going to sell him the truck even after he cursed out everyone in the dealership. He continued to act like a child and got very aggressive with our finance manager. We were very respectful to him but it was 3 hours of cursing. He fails to mention his actions. We wish you luck on your reservation with the other dealer. Hopefully you don't act like that guy

P.S - Fantastic color choice, [picked mine up too yesterday ](https://i.imgur.com/Ugct2lY.jpg).","<div class=""md""><p>So happy for you. I had made a post over at the <a href=""https://www.f150lightningforum.com/forum/threads/dealer-refuses-to-sell-the-lightning-to-the-person-who-ordered-marks-it-up-by-50k-and-puts-it-on-the-lot.11468/"">F150Lightningforum</a> and many others chimed in having a similar experience at that dealer. I doubt they are going to change anything but atleast they will be a dealer to avoid on a lot of people’s list.</p>

<p>Somebody emailed the manager asking about it and this is the shit they send</p>

<blockquote>
<p>He didn&#39;t say the whole story. We were going to sell him the truck even after he cursed out everyone in the dealership. He continued to act like a child and got very aggressive with our finance manager. We were very respectful to him but it was 3 hours of cursing. He fails to mention his actions. We wish you luck on your reservation with the other dealer. Hopefully you don&#39;t act like that guy</p>

TechnicalWhore,"The entrenched powers will always push back at innovation.  In some cases they have a valid point in others its just salacious BS to attempt to make a point.  Recall there WAS a time when there were not gas stations everywhere and long road trips were equally difficult. The infrastructure developed and the need was filled. EV's run on electricity and we have a mature power grid.  Its just the last bit and with adequate investment that is solved in no time. Germany and Sweden went ""all in"" and have very few issues.  New battery tech (and more just making it to evaluation phase) will decrease charge times and increase range.

But understand. We MUST do this. The Climate Change data is real and its an existential threat.  If you doubt that please engage with reliable sources. The damage being done may not be entirely reversible.  EV's are a huge step in that direction. The alternative is more extreme weather events happening more often. Flooding and drought. Crop yield instability.  Resource skirmishes (wars).  Market collapses, etc.

FantasticMeddler,"People that buy trucks like this want to be able to tow. They don’t mind refueling but refueling is easy and fast. It’s hard to reconcile the point of a truck that needs to be recharged every hundred miles if you tow stuff and there is nowhere to be found that can do it fast. Then you are just charging to 80% of range anyway. Can be maddening.

They will never stop and compare the 330 range to the full EV gas tank rank of 550. If they tow they get ..I don’t know, a fraction of it on gas or ev, but the difference is the convenience and ease of mind. 

The best optimization an EV owner can hope for is access to the supercharger network and the native Tesla port comparability. If there were level 3 stations that could get you to 80-100% in 30 minutes everywhere, then you might have a shot. If the places you waited were nice destinations that is even better.

But until there is a “level 4” that can do it in 10 minutes, there just will always be people pissing on this “edge case”.","<div class=""md""><p>People that buy trucks like this want to be able to tow.

DogNamedCharlie,"To be honest I have been a bit suprised with how many Tesla to Ford converts there are for both the Lightning and the Mach-E. The overall feedback it seems is a lot of people like the ride that the Fords have versus the Teslas in both the Mach-E and Lightning.

We own both a Mach-E and a Lightning never owning a Tesla prior. My previous F-150 PowerBoost felt weak after driving a demo Lightning. The rear independent suspension also helps vs. the more truck like ride of the solid rear suspension.

Tesla did a great job of getting the ball rolling for BEVs, I think Ford is doing a great of bringing competition to the market, which is good for consumers.","<div class=""md""><p>To be honest I have been a bit suprised with how many Tesla to Ford converts there are for both the Lightning and the Mach-E.

CoffeeClarity,"Early reservation holder as well (day 3?) for a dual motor Cybertruck.  Recently got a '23 Lightning PRO and love it; after I dug more into specs and pricing the Lightning was the clear winner for my use case and it's roughly half the price (Cybertruck is just not worth it).  

Very happy with our choice, the useability of this thing is really awesome. Huge frunk, parts interchangeable with regular F-150, wireless android auto, nice blend of tactile buttons/screens, tons of interior space with kiddos, looks like a typical truck, way lower insurance premium, vinyl floors/seats, really quick and the list just goes on.

This is why the CT lost my interest.  The *entire point* of it looking weird was that it would unlock new capabilities while also being cheap to manufacture.  As soon as it became a traditional body-on-frame truck, the odd design became a solution in search of a problem.

It also highlights just how refined the F150 is at this point.  It's bland looking because it's the result of 50 years worth of trial and error.  Ford was smart to build off of that expertise.","<div class=""md""><blockquote>

Emlerith,"Fellow Day 1 CT reservation holder here, bought my Lightning (Lariat ER) in November. Also own a Model Y from about a year ago. I cancelled my CT order a couple of weeks ago.

The short of it is the CT got bait and switched. It got reduced functionality in some key areas and, as you mentioned, doubled in price. I've come to appreciate the reality that the CT is an interesting Gen 1 concept and I'd benefit greatly from waiting and seeing the evolution of the concept - both in terms of cost and capabilities.

In the meantime, I've fallen in love with my Lightning. While I love the minimalist format of the interior of a Tesla, it's hard to argue that the Lightning doesn't feel so much more feature complete when you're sitting in the driver seat. Once the network opens up (which is a non-issue for me as road trips are rare), I really don't see a downside to owning a Lightning.","<div class=""md""><p>Fellow Day 1 CT reservation holder here, bought my Lightning (Lariat ER) in November.

elfilberto,Not exactly the same but by bolt had a battery failure and our dealership told us 3 weeks to just get it in.  Called a few other dealerships and we had it in 45 minutes later.  Battery needed to be replaced no available loaners.  They called corporate and pulled a new Silverado off the lot for her.  Told 4-6 weeks for a battery.  Car was back in about 2.5 weeks.   She drives 1000 miles a week and i think they pulled some strings to get it faster so they didn’t end up with a new truck with 6000 miles on it.  My message to all EV owners is dealership matters and do your research on dealerships.,"<div class=""md""><p>Not exactly the same but by bolt had a battery failure and our dealership told us 3 weeks to just get it in.

tturedditor,"Tesla owner for close to a decade chiming in here.  I personally would NEVER buy an EV from any auto company selling mostly ICE vehicles.  Their corporate culture does not reflect a dedication to EV’s in the long term, IMO, and the dealership model means many are flat out antagonistic to EV’s in general.  
 
It is absolutely absurd for any car company to roll out EV’s without a charging infrastructure plan.  EA is an absolute joke and a third party that can (and likely will) vanish overnight.

Tesla’s network is good and becoming exceptionally good as they continue to add new locations at a rapid clip.  Many will piggyback on that network and that is fine.  But any company that hasn’t negotiated that before manufacturing their own EV’s is disingenuous at best.

Having chargers at dealerships is an absolute joke.  Completely inadequate even if the dealerships are on board, which it appears they are not.  

If you want to embrace EV’s I would stick with companies who are exclusively EV or others if they show an extremely high level of commitment to the EV movement—-including infrastructure and service (service should be minimal compared to ICE but readily available).

The traditional dealership model is build on big profits from service.  EV’s require considerably less service.  It’s like putting a square peg in a round hole, absolutely never going to work unless the company is fully committed.
 
Most of the legacy autos are putting larger ICE trucks on the road in big numbers and not focused on EV’s, no matter how much they say otherwise.  Just walk around a parking lot anywhere in the country and you will see evidence of it.","<div class=""md""><p>Tesla owner for close to a decade chiming in here.

I saw you’d talked about how it shuts off the AC if you open the frunk after remote starting, which I really hope they fix.

Worse that happens is that it sits for a while before they give up and lower or remove the mark up… until then all they are doing is keeping a good product off of people’s hands.

This is exactly why I hate dealerships. I’d be happy to never set foot in one again if possible.","<div class=""md""><p>They can afford to keep them marked up since they didn’t order them. That means they don’t pay Ford to keep the cars in the lot (if I remember that correctly)</p>

RushFactoryGarage,The dealer we ordered my wife’s Bronco didn’t do markups so naturally I thought they won’t charge me markups on my reservation for my XLT. Wrong! I cancelled mine last month when they were gonna put a 7k markup.

TSS997,"I was having an ""argument"" if you can call it that not too long ago with regard to the Lightning but the same can be said about vehicles in general. This person did a quick search and saw how many Lightnings were for sale on Autotrader and came to the conclusion Ford is pushing EVs no one wanted to buy. My position was there's more buyers than Ford can keep up with, its just that the wave of folks who wanted a vehicle no matter the cost has ended. Now, very few people are going to pay a markup 10-20% of the MSRP. It makes much more sense to spend 15 minutes or less to find a dealer from the various forums that won't charge a markup.

Not to say that the Lightning isn't expensive, but people were already paying similar for the ICE F150 while still fitting in the EV use case.","<div class=""md""><p>I was having an &quot;argument&quot; if you can call it that not too long ago with regard to the Lightning but the same can be said about vehicles in general.

panzerfinder15,"Great write up, thanks!

Just one counterpoint, the door pockets in the R1T are actually designed to fit camelbak and Nalgene water bottles, so they are bottle pockets in the door.  I can fit 3 bottles in each front door pocket and a single bottle in each rear door.  

I am an R1T owner also interested in the Lightning, and we actually primarily use the door pockets as cup/bottle holders.

A center console rear cup holder would have been nice for cans or open top drinks though and is definitely a miss when you have three peeps in the back.

Really enjoyed reading your write up, I think you nailed everything else spot on!  

I also have the powered tonneau cover, and agree the design of the manual cover is a royal PIA, though the powered tonneau is awesome.

I had to have a parking sensor replaced and it was a 3 month wait.

OpinionBearSF,"That is the trim and color I want! (White exterior helps keep some heat down in hotter states)

A couple of questions about the Pro trim with no options if you don't mind?

- Does it have adaptive cruise control?
- If it does, does the Pro trim adaptive cruise control let you do stop and go driving, IE, go all the way down to a stop and auto resume within a couple minutes?
- Does it have a 240V connector in the truck bed, or just the standard house 120V plugs? I'm not sure if the standard 2.4 kW package includes it. I don't think it does.
- If it has no options, can you tell us the listed amount of payload on the sticker in the door jamb please?

RentalGore,"Exactly the same color and truck I got in July.  Love it, it’s my fourth F150.  I’ve had no issues whatsoever, we regularly do 600 mile trips on weekends, and with planning, everything works out great.  I have had a couple issues with electrify America stations, but, nothing that caused panic.

I one pedal drive almost entirely and my Mi/kWh is around 2.5-2.7 city and 2.1 highway (at 70mph, 2.3-2.4 65mph).

Towing hasn’t been an issue, I lose between 20-30% range, although our travel trailer is only around 2,000 lbs.

It’s getting colder and I’ve found range has dropped about 8% - but it’s only been 2-3 drives at sub 40 degrees - so I’ll be interested to see what happens.

Anyway, enjoy the truck, I love mine.

Also, obligatory - get a wrap, ceramic or some other protectant, at least for the crucial areas.  This thing is big and it eats bugs and rocks.  I came from an F150 lariat and had the same comment there.","<div class=""md""><p>Exactly the same color and truck I got in July.  Love it, it’s my fourth F150.

My truck has been flawless matter how hard I drive it. Far as I’m concerned, the best truck in its class on the roads in North America and perhaps the best vehicle all together. Not counting a nice Audi or Porsche EV of course.

Think-Work1411,"Nice, you’ll enjoy it. Blue Cruise may take a few days to activate, so don’t worry about that. There is a big update coming for Blue Cruise that will make it much better, so don’t panic when it disconnects a lot, as that will be fixed soon. And for now don’t trust it hands free around other vehicles. 
For updates don’t connect it to your home WiFi, that’s what they tell you to do, but for some reason it often blocks updates, they do better downloading over the built in modem if you have any shred of at&t signal at home.
Also, try to avoid distracting the computer when the Frunk is opening or closing, opening the tailgate, locking /unlocking the doors or unplugging the charging cord can sometimes get the Frunk lid stuck half way. It can usually be resolved by starting the open again, but I have had to manually close that, recent software updates seem to have helped the one thing at a time issue the computer was having, the downside of that update is that music may skip or stutter occasionally, as it no longer has the highest priority on the system, while it can be annoying, everything else has been more reliable since that change. Also you will see a range drop in the winter starting when it goes below 75 degrees and getting noticeable worse when below freezing, this is normal and some of it can be avoided by pre-conditioning with departure times and using the built in navigation when your doing a long road trip with charging stops, as it will warm the batteries before a planned charging stop so your charging can start be sure to start immediately in sub freezing temps.

I love that it's made of steel, I love that it's totally different, and tbh, I love my other Teslas.  But I need a bigger back seat and I use the frunk a lot more than I ever thought I would.

djryan13,"One other charging option for you is to consider buying a better portable charger that can take multiple adapters. For example, my older Model S came with the gen1 portable charger that had a bunch of adapters for various plugs options (5-15, 6-20, 14-50, etc). 
During COVID, I was renovating so I couldn’t get in my garage to charge due to renovations I was slowly doing. I used a garage wall plug instead. It was a 6-20 plug which gave me an extra couple miles per hour for the Model S compared to the 5-15 which was just enough for work and back with a.little extra.

[deleted],"You fail to understand physics.

1. You’re driving a big stupid vehicle with the aerodynamics of a 2x4
2. You say “I was only driving 80 in a square box.” The difference in energy between 70mph & 80mph is going to consume 30% more energy to overcome resistance.
3. Wind speed against your vehicle is the same as if you were driving 5-10mph faster, requiring more energy to overcome.

These principles apply to gasoline as well. It’s just that people conveniently don’t think about their gasoline use. You still use the same increased energy if burning gas.","<div class=""md""><p>You fail to understand physics.</p>

[deleted],"I completely understand why the OP was shocked at the massive drop in range, even given the mistakes made in not fully charging and driving too fast. The bottom line is EVs require a paradigm shift in driving habits. People used to the more predictable loss of range in ICE vehicles are likely to be disappointed when their EV seems to lose range unexpectedly. 99% of my trips are 50 miles radius, (Portland, OR, 40 miles away, is my most frequent out of town destination) so my SR Lightning Lariat is ideal for me. In my 2018 F150 I could have technically made that trip with 1/4 tank of gas. I wouldn't attempt it in the Lightning without a full charge. Since I charge at home that's zero inconvenience to me, but for someone who regularly tows or drives long distances stopping frequently and waiting for chargers needs to be accounted for. Driving most of your life in ICE vehicles and not really giving much thought to range, then moving to an EV and having to factor range into your regular commute is a whole different way of thinking.","<div class=""md""><p>I completely understand why the OP was shocked at the massive drop in range, even given the mistakes made in not fully charging and driving too fast.

TopEstablishment2759,"Congrats!!  I got mine (Platinum in Antimatter Blue)  just over a month ago. 1700 heavenly miles since then, and I'm still on cloud nine!  

The Ford Charger arrived about 2 weeks later.   Still in the box because I planned ahead and had an Emporia installed about 2 weeks before the truck arrived. I didn't have a good plan for what to do with the Ford charger (I think I'll sell it or have it installed at a future home) but I didn't want to risk not having a charger when the truck came and having to struggle with the ""trickle charger.""

I have always wondered why Ford can't manage to have the charger delivered at the same time as the truck (or even earlier for the bonafide purchasers out there).

Anyway, I lover my Lightning, I love my charger, congratulations, welcome to the group, and I hope your experience is even better than mine has been!!","<div class=""md""><p>Congrats!!
