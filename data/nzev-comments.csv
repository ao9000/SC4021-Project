"This is incredible!!! I'm hoping to get an EV I can sleep/camp in as I will need to sell my campervan to pay for the house I'm building (eco-friendly, passive, low energy). In the long run I'd like to get another campervan, but electric, but for now I'm considering a used Kona. 

Did you consider any prebuilt options for your platform? I assume you're mainly staying at holiday parks so you can have access to facilities like toilets - does that mean you pay for a powered site and plug the car in, and if so do you have to have a different cord to plug in to the caravan outlet at the site? Or do you stay somewhere like a DOC campground, use their toilets, and then make other stops during the day to charge (or maybe you're just not driving far enough you need to recharge since you must have quite good range)? Thanks, I'd love to hear any lessons learned before I go down this route.","<div class=""md""><p>This is incredible!!!

I feel the crux of the issue here is the fact that petrol taxes are used both for reducing carbon emissions as well as road maintenance. Introducing the RUC for electric cars is not unreasonable for road maintenance but there also needs to be a fair way to attribute costs. This could be done if ALL vehicles pay RUC and they should increase with the weight of the vehicle because that targets the user pays point of RUC where vehicles that do the most damage to roads pay the most for their upkeep. But that doesn't help NZ meet our greenhouse gas reduction targets which should be associate with fuel. If they separated the pay at pump taxes and applied RUC to all vehicles and trailers then it would achieve both purposes.,"<div class=""md""><p>I feel the crux of the issue here is the fact that petrol taxes are used both for reducing carbon emissions as well as road maintenance.

"So 1000 km for $88.44 ($76 + $12.44).

1000/88.44 = 11.3071

&#x200B;

This means, if you are using an EV, every 11.3 km you travel, you will be penalized $1.

For example, commuting to work from East Tamaki to Newmarket is 22km, that means each day you will pay $4 in RUC for commuting.

If you buy a 2021 Toyota Corolla, it has a fuel efficiency of 3.5 - 6.5 L/100KM.According to [this](https://www.gaspy.nz/stats.html) website, the average price of fuel in NZ over the last 4 weeks is 2.68.

This means, a 2021 Toyota Corolla would cost between $4.13 to $7.66 to make the same 44km commute.

&#x200B;

It is absolutely INSANE that an efficient ICE vehicle can make the same trip, and pay as much for petrol as an EV does for RUC. INSANE.

&#x200B;

EDIT: Since Fuel Excise Tax is set at 45.02c per litre, that means the 2021 Toyota Corolla I used in my example would use between $0.68 to $1.31 in Road User Charges.

"In my case, commute about 80km per day. Ice SUV (2.4L) currently gets about 7.5L/100km. Last few petrol fill ups were $2.569. Therefore, costs me about (7.5/100)\*80 = 6L which is 6\*$2.569 = $15.47 to do a round trip.

To calculate RUCS I would pay to do this in an EV - I would do it in 5000km bundles - costing $12.44 + 5\*76 = $392.44. Which is 392.44/5000 = $0.0784/km. 80km \* 0.0784 = $6.279. Charging cost - assume $3/100km so (3/100)\*80 = $2.40. So total is $8.67 for a commute in an EV and $15.47 in a big SUV. So give or take, the EV would still be about 56% the price of driving an ICE vehicle - previously would have been 15%!

Considering the fact that a comparable EV would be about 2.5-3x the price of the my ICE vehicle, as much as it would be nice to have an EV this pushes the equation out for me a lot further.

However, in more urban traffic driving you could easily push 9-10L per 100km and if petrol prices were $3+ the equation would still be pretty good in the EVs case.","<div class=""md""><p>In my case, commute about 80km per day.

For example, Ford needs to buy credits to offset all those Rangers, while Toyota and BYD have credits to sell with all those Aquas and Atto 3s. Over time, this means high-emitting vehicle prices go up and lower-emitting vehicle prices go down - CCD by stealth!</p>

"That’s quite a one sided reporting job. 
I suggest reading the report (linked in the article) as it goes through the many issues with the clean car discount scheme including assumed decreases of the discount amount. 

Their assumption of uptake with the CCD ending is also ‘medium certainty’. 

Personally I think this will increase competition within dealers which is a good thing. They all have made big investments to bring their EV cars to this market and need to hit sales numbers. Just this week Tesla has started 0% interest deals in Germany. Who will be the first to offer $2,000 Chargenet credit with a purchase etc?

If the CCD discount was to only be a few thousand $ in a year or so’s time then it can be on the market to suck that up imo","<div class=""md""><p>That’s quite a one sided reporting job.

<p>For the same trip, the Prime will get ~40km on EV charge (6Kwh so maybe $1.50 to charge depending on your rates) before switching to petrol and burning 2.86 litres ($7.43). Then another $0.053 per km RUCs ($5.30) bringing it to a total of $14.23....</p>

"I don’t think it’s going to be one or the other. I don’t think H2 is viable in most cases at the moment. And it may never be with cars. 

But a more efficient production of H2 may have more important industrial benefits, as I understand most H2 at the moment actually is tied to fossil fuels, not electrolysis of water (I can’t remember the details sorry).


If a more efficient commercial process is realised, then there would be investment for those industrial cases. And cheaper hydrogen may not be mainstream vehicles, but used as a power storage for remote locations, like Antarctica or central Australia as a green alternative to diesel generation.


And if the tech improves further there, it could then be a more efficient potion for consumer vehicles.


This, of course, requires technological advances in H2. And assumes no advances in “conventional” EVs. But H2 has been much harder than expected, and battery tech has some really promising advances on the way. If I were to place a bet, I would bet against H2. But no more than $1000. I feel there is still so many advances in tech and commerce that it’s hard to tell even what will be best in 10 years time.

"There are a few things to consider here.

Despite the electricity being 100% renewable, the right-hand column still uses crude oil to produce petrol/diesel/jet fuel etc. So this column is going to be discounted off the bat.

This leaves only Battery electric and liquid hydrogen / fuel cell columns.

You might look at the overall efficiency and say, this is an easy choice. But batteries, despite being very efficient, are also very heavy. Once you load a plane or boat up with enough batteries to run the engines, their range is reduced drastically.

So a compromise has to be made, if you want to retain your long range flights, but move away from crude oil, then for that liquid hydrogen is currently the best choice.

"I'm going to throw in another thought, perhaps some nice soul will fact check it for me and see how valid it could be:

RUC charges were set in a time where the price of diesel was approximately half that of petrol and fuel prices were relatively stable. Also, as diesel was predominately used in agricultural equipment, it was easier to add the difference to vehicles in the road. 

Now EVs get out into the same category for RUCs as the diesel vehicles and so pay the same rate, which I don't think has been adjusted for a long time. Vehicles have become more fuel efficient since the introduction of RUC which skews the OPs stats a little, but it is what it is. 

I might be talking out of my ass here but it's possible that, at the moment, EVs are paying a higher $/km travelled because the math hasn't been adjusted over the last 20-30years.

Personally I have no problem with the whole system going to RUCs for all vehicles and it should be done on a graduated weight cost per km. i.e the heavier your vehicle, the more you pay per km.

 I am looking to finally upgrade from my (non-PHEV) Prius into a BEV of some description next year (gotta sort out being able to charge at home first).

Next cheapest ~60kwh option would be the MG4 but that's $45k (after rebate) - a whole $10/20% more expensive. Anyway...just rambling here.

"No surprises there for most EV owners. The extra year's RUC holiday for hybrids isn't something that's been stated before though.

The whole RUC system is due for a redesign so that year of RUCs for EVs before the hybrids are brought into the net will cause some inequities. If the diesel rate is applied to EVs they will become more expensive to run (on public charging) than a small ICE so counterproductive action in terms of incentivising EVs.

In the long term everybody is likely to be paying distance based RUCs with the FET removed from petrol to make it fair for the fossil fuelers. Then tweak the carbon tax to disincentivise larger ICEs and balance up costs of small ICEs and hybrids vs. EV. The only issue is the size of the admin that Waka Kotahi will require to run it all.

Then tweak the carbon tax to disincentivise larger ICEs and balance up costs of small ICEs and hybrids vs. EV. The only issue is the size of the admin that Waka Kotahi will require to run it all. A tracked system similar to E-Road perhaps? Time will tell.</p>

"Just did some quick math for myself. Currently have a Prius and contemplating switching it out for an Ioniq. And by ""I did math"" , I mean I asked ChatGPT to do it for me....

Prius -- At $3/l, it costs 13.4c to drive 1km.  

Ioniq EV -- At 12c/kwh (Contact's EV plan) - it costs 4.8c to drive 1km. Add a 7.6c RUC - and that's 12.4c/km. 

Sounds fair, but I don't think it is. The Ioniq EV is one of the most efficient EVs and the 12c/kwh Contact plan is about as cheap as you're gonna get charging it (shy of a solar install, or the ""free 9pm-midnight plan). So this is nearly the most efficient/cheapest scenario for EVs. Granted, the Prius is one of the most efficient scenarios for a non-plugin.  

But this is the difference. HEVs are inherently rewarded for their efficiency as their ""RUC"" (fuel tax) is charged per unit of fuel. So a Prius at better than 20 km/l effectively pays half as much ""RUC"" as a conventional car getting closer to 10 km/l. With the EV paying it on a per distance traveled and not per unit of energy, there is absolutely no difference between driving an Ioniq and driving a Hummer EV - except the electricity consumed. 

So yeah, this system is still inherently broken and unfair.","<div class=""md""><p>Just did some quick math for myself. Currently have a Prius and contemplating switching it out for an Ioniq. And by &quot;I did math&quot; , I mean I asked ChatGPT to do it for me....</p>

I'm not really bothered by how much I pay, I'm bothered by how much profit-taking businesses don't pay, that someone else has to, sooner or later. 

(But yeah if the oversize ute does 5x the damage my EV does, isn't it fair he pays 5x the RUC - if we're actually talking about ""user pays""?)

u/s_nz unsure why but I can't reply to you - maybe because old mate blocked me. Appreciate your informative response.","<div class=""md""><blockquote>

On Chargenet, the default charge option is to 80%, you need to select ""Max Charge"" if it's available.   Chargenet has a $1 per-minute charge if your EV remains connected to the charger five minutes after your charging session has ended - by unplugging you, they may have saved you from that.

"I just want to add that sometimes there is a good reason for another person unplugging your vehicle as it's not always clear when you're not around watching the session.

I recently encountered a situation where a person had the Chargenet charger set to maximum 100%. But once it hit 80% the charger session went haywire - the charge status reset to 0% and although the machine tried to keep putting energy in, the car wasn't taking any. Eventually the session stopped after 5 minutes of it continuously trying and the charger unlocked. The app instructed the owner to unplug, but they were nowhere in sight. I'd been waiting in queue 30mins by this point and unplugged the car so I could start mine.

I don't know why their car stopped charging at 80 despite being set to max on the charger (perhaps some cars have an on board setting preventing charges from going above 80%?), but what I do know is their session had ended legitimately by chargenet, and the owner wasn't at the car, so I did what I needed to do.","<div class=""md""><p>I just want to add that sometimes there is a good reason for another person unplugging your vehicle as it&#39;s not always clear when you&#39;re not around watching the session.</p>

The cut off occurs before any of the other pins disconnect, and well before the pins are exposed to the outside world from within the protection of the plug and socket.

Cars like the Jimney and the Swift should be cheap why the hell are we subsidising 80k+ luxury vehicles. 

Now while I agree hybrid owners may possibly be a bit hard done by the RUC change the EV’s are fine and to anyone crying about it this is not national giving EV’s RUC’s it’s the exemption running out of time it would have happened with labour too only they would have likely kept the subsidy and tax. 
And the RUC’s are cheep to boot a Tesla is paying the same RUC’s as my 2000 Toyota hilux while being 3/4 of a tonne heavier. 

The only car I could say the subsidy should have stayed for is things like the leaf, it’s small and efficient. 

But also companies tend to jack up prices when there is a subsidy so they make more money so who then does the subsidy go to? 
And to those saying that doesn’t happen well it happened with every other subsidy why do you think this one was any different. 

Plus the economy is a bit shot right now so no telling how it has effected the numbers can’t solely blame the government.

I think part of the reason it's good is that we have very few actual EVs on the road. Only 1.4% of cars on the road are EVs so you're not very likely to run into other EVs on the open road that need to use chargers at the same time. Even in cities like Auckland you could use free charging in malls without competition until quite recently.

"There is one particular family to thank for investing a heap of effort and money into ev charging in NZ, back at a time when ev's were so rare there was no hope of a financial return in the near term.

This, (with a bit of help from the goverment via the eeca contestiable fund) has given us the chargenet network we have today.

Chargenet has now largely completed the task of building DC chargers every 75km or less along major travel routes, meaning it is possible to road trip in a shorter range EV if one has a lot of time available. They are now building out a network of hyperchargers. (Typically, 2x 300kW units each able to share that power around 3 cars). To serve modern longer range EVs on the most busy routes.

Add this with other smaller charging providers and we have a sweet network.


Of course our networks arn't without their flaws:
- free lines company dc chargers in urban areas (I.e. vector in auckland), have crowded out the commercial operators, and get absolutely slammed by locals looking foe free power. Means fast charging is hard to come by in places like the central North shore of auckland.
- end up with a large stack of apps, fobs etc.
- some relatively dead spots (like New Plymoth).
- South island has relatively few chargers above 50kW, and many of those thst are are limited to 200A, which is well means 400v cars can't max out the charger.","<div class=""md""><p>There is one particular family to thank for investing a heap of effort and money into ev charging in NZ, back at a time when ev&#39;s were so rare there was no hope of a financial return in the near term.</p>

"Interesting perspective, thanks for sharing. From my experience the NZ charging infrastructure is subpar. I just had 7 weeks traveling around the UK, Europe (mostly Germany), and Canada, and for me it just highlighted how much we lag behind. Canada had the least-good charging of all the places I visited, but it still had more chargers than I've seen in NZ. The UK and Germany were awesome, there were so many chargers to choose from and most of them were 200-350 kW.

IMO NZ doesn't have enough chargers, and the ones it has are too slow. It's way better than it was when I bought my first EV 6 years ago, but it's still really annoying if you want to take a long trip on the weekend or a public holiday. Hopefully in the next 5 years or so we will get more 300+ kW chargers because at the moment the queues can be awful.","<div class=""md""><p>Interesting perspective, thanks for sharing.

The Kia Niro seems to be missing (yep the 2021 and 2022 models are sold out but there are some still available on TM - I think you could price the entry level EX at around 75k based on the current inflated prices). The claimed range is 455km, and the MY23 version should arrive sometime after July according to my local dealer. 

It would be nice to see it on here given that it’s [pretty popular in Europe](https://cleantechnica.com/2021/03/27/kia-e-niro-gets-upgraded-to-e-niro-2-holds-a-new-market-record/) and IMO is more of a family-oriented EV that doesn’t go full SUV and is not a huge step away from a convention ICE car (not a purpose-built EV, lots of physical buttons, feels pretty familiar, enough boot space to be practical without being huge).

It’s also looks like it’s smaller cousin the Kona is missing. 

PS: I may be a little biased and looking for some reassurance as I’ve put down a deposit on a MY21 Ex that I’m hoping to go an pick up once I’ve finished my COVID isolation period. :unamused_face:

"Thanks for the heads up:

My/our comments
RUC is a relatively robust way to provide income for road maintenance. However its management system is outdated. When I lived in Queensland in 2013, the QLD Government did away with vehicle licence windscreen stickers as they were not required in today's internet connected age. Over a decade later NZ still requires not only licence tags on windscreens, but RUC tags also. 


Making EV users pay RUC now is a small thing, bringing in a small increase in road funding. The big issue is getting all road using vehicle onto the same system, and updating the systems to make it easy for people to pay for licences and RUC without having to display wondscreen stickers. 


Windscreen displays are an administrative burden requiring visiting a store, or waiting around a week for delivery if ordering online. They are also costly to produce and administer, and bad for the environment. 

With internet connected police and a national licence plate database, there is no valid reason that we need to continue with a windscreen display system. 

We absolutely must have a system that is user focussed
My/our recommendations
1. Make sure that progression to a consistent RUC system covering all road users is rapid and robust. Bringing EV's into the RUC system must remain seen as a first step only.

2. Setup the new system like paying for tolls. Have phone app versions to manage as well as a website. Notification, Text, and/or Email alert to update km's in the app/website which then auto-deduct from your link card/bank direct debit etc for the km's travelled. No need to bulk buy in advance which becomes an issue when you sell the vehicle. A system charging in arears is far easier to manage for both users and system administrators.","<div class=""md""><p>Thanks for the heads up:</p>

Submission on the Road User Charges (Light Electric RUC Vehicles) Amendment Bill

Introduction

The Road User Charges (Light Electric RUC Vehicles) Amendment Bill has sparked considerable debate, particularly regarding the proposed fees for light electric vehicles (EVs) and their impact on various aspects of New Zealand’s economy and environment. In this submission, we delve into the reasons why these fees are excessive compared to petrol excise, and how they may affect our nation’s climate goals, EV adoption, second-hand EV availability, and export income.



1. Excessive Fees

1.1 Comparison with Petrol Excise

The Bill aims to require owners of light EVs and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) to pay road user charges (RUCs) from April 1, 20241. While the intention is to ensure fair contributions to road maintenance costs, the proposed fees appear disproportionately high when compared to the existing petrol excise system.



1.2 Impact on EV Affordability

The excessive RUCs could deter potential EV buyers. New Zealand has been actively promoting EV adoption to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and combat climate change. However, imposing high charges on light EVs contradicts this goal. If the fees become a barrier, it may hinder the transition to cleaner transportation options.



2. Climate Impact

2.1 Discouraging EV Uptake

By discouraging EV adoption, the Bill indirectly contributes to higher emissions from petrol vehicles. EVs play a crucial role in achieving our climate targets by reducing tailpipe emissions. Penalizing them with excessive RUCs undermines our commitment to combatting climate change.



2.2 Missed Opportunity for Emission Reduction

Light EVs are inherently more environmentally friendly than their petrol counterparts. By incentivizing their adoption, we can significantly reduce our carbon footprint. However, the proposed fees may lead to missed opportunities for emission reduction, hindering our progress toward a greener future.



3. Second-Hand EV Market

3.1 Impact on Availability

High RUCs for light EVs could affect the second-hand market. As EVs become more popular, the availability of used EVs will increase. However, if RUCs make ownership cost-prohibitive, potential buyers may opt for petrol vehicles instead. This could limit the supply of second-hand EVs, hindering affordability and accessibility.



4. Paris Accord Commitments

4.1 Struggling to Meet Targets

New Zealand is committed to the Paris Agreement, aiming to limit global warming to well below 2°C. Our ability to meet these targets depends on aggressive emission reductions. Excessive RUCs for light EVs undermine this commitment, potentially jeopardizing our climate goals and impacting our access to European export markets



Conclusion

While road maintenance funding is essential, the Road User Charges (Light Electric RUC Vehicles) Amendment Bill must strike a balance. Excessive fees for light EVs risk undermining our climate efforts, limiting EV adoption, and hindering economic growth. We urge policymakers to reconsider the proposed charges and align them with our environmental and economic aspirations.","<div class=""md""><p>Had Copilot AI cut me a response, feel free to reuse/edit and submit</p>

"So ""kilowatts"" should almost always be discussed in terms of kilowatts per unit of time. Typically, this is per hour...so the term to describe an amount of power is ""kilowatt hour"".

Yes, EVs take a lot of power. But most EVs have a battery of 80 kilowatt hours or less. So, if you're ""charging at 137 kilowatts"" what that really means is you're adding 135 kilowatt hours to your batter *per hour*. This means that a battery at 20 percent charging to 80 percent (typical) will need about 50 kilowatt hours of juice. At 137 kwh per hour your car will be charged up in about 20 minutes.

So if a house consumes 1.25 kwh per hour (let's just assume that's the correct average) that's 30 kwh per day...it takes as much power to charge an EV up with an equivalent of a tank of gas as the average home uses in about a day and a half.

"Well...yeah.

That was always going to happen.

If ICE couldn't rely on zero-rating the cost of R&D paid for 50 years ago it'd be similarly expensive. If demand for materials was assured cheaper and less filthy ways to mine/extract would have been invested in years ago. The world of 10 years from now is going to have better, more easily produced and recycled EVs. 

ICE will remain more or less the same since we're in the ""diminishing returns"" phase of technological development. We're unlikely to find any way of drastically improving mass manufacturing or fuel supply for ICE at this stage but there's already a steady pipeline of R&D and supply chain improvements that shows us EVs will drop costs. 

As a huge fan of engineering I love it when particularly Mazda comes out with really efficient new ideas but I'm more enthralled with the cleverness than the ever decreasing percentage improvements. Meanwhile we've just started with EVs, really, and metrics are nowhere near reaching a plateau.","<div class=""md""><p>Well...yeah.</p>

"The market has been moving forward at a crazy pace.

Generally EV's getting better is a much of a factor as price drops.

In 2011 a 24kWh Nissan leaf was $70k. In late 2013, Nissan NZ brought the ex-aussie 2011 build date leaf's and sold them for $40 or $50k. Subsequently there have been 30kWh, 40kWh & 62kWh version of the leaf, with the latter asking $56,990 from Nissan NZ. 2.6x the range & twice the motor power, for a cheaper price, all in just 13 years...

BMW i3 went through the same. 60Ah battery, replaced by 90Ah, replaced by 120Ah.  (then discontinued as they rolled out plug in cars across their entire model lineup).

Lexus UX300e, jumped from 54.3kWh to 72.8kWh battery capacity with no price change etc.  


Next few years are going to be interesting for EV's. Production capacity has caught up with demand, and ranges are hitting a point where they are arguable ""enough"" for many use cases (I argue that as long as we assume a smallish country with a good charging network like NZ, and no towing, a 500km range EV is sufficient)","<div class=""md""><p>The market has been moving forward at a crazy pace.</p>

"Pretty much every day now in the New Zealand Sub-Reddit:

*OMG, petrol is more than $3 a litre!*

Solutions include eat the rich/subsidy's for fuel/stop fuel tax etc. Very rarely do the posters say what they are driving or what options they have looked at to reduce fuel costs

You suggest they consider an EV as one option and it's 'but Teslas are $70k' or 'Leafs are too small/ugly*' (for my ego). 

It's fustrating as global climate change and the impact of events in Ukraine don't seem to be obvious to some.

There is a range of options of course including some mix of BEV/PHEV/HEV cars, public transport, motorbike/scooter, EBike, Bicycles, WFH, moving closer to work/working closer to home etc, but seems like a lot of people just want to continue to burn cheap fossil fuels

Really needs an FAQ as the same objections come up time and time again

"Some of the reasons listed in the original reddit post are why I have a Kia EV6 rather than a Y. What I really wanted was a Skoda enyak, but they didn't have a timeline for NZ release when I was wanting to upgrade my car. Still really pleased with my EV6 though. Thank goodness that due to Tesla getting into mass production of EVs it increased the pressure on existing manufacturers to really get serious about the EV market so we now have more options. 

Some of it sounds like the person just didnt do much research or test driving. Teslas are very different to operate as a driver with the lack of normal controls. Some love it, some hate it. I am also weirded out by the glass roof. Can someone please tell me that I am not the only person who hates having street lights shining at them from above or motorway signs pass directly overhead. It is just at the edge of my peripheral awareness and it is a massive distraction/weirding out factor for me. It took me ages to work out why I was always a bit anxious after a while in a Tesla.

For ICE this is the volatility of international prices + ETS charges increasing with time (probably not for a while under this government, but eventually). For EVs that would be generation cost increases as we get drier and drier years (and more and more demand).

"Not a bad generalisation but everyone’s circumstances will be different, especially given those with EVs would probably have a better than ‘normal’ power plan.

For example, I pay 22c on peak and 11c off peak.  My plan allows me to use public charging at the same pricing.

Also I’ve done just under 30k km in my model Y with an average consumption of 14.7 kw/h per 100.

Figuratively let‘s say i only charged in off peak with RUC @ 30k kms that would be:

"Comparing a new (or near new) EV and ICE vehicle isn’t going to give you the full comparison of longer term maintenance costs.

If you take a car that’s 5-10+ years old, that’s where you start to see some major difference in maintenance costs.

Once an ICE car gets to a mature age where things like timing belts (or chain tensioners), head gaskets, water pumps and pulleys, fuel pumps, transmission servicing, etc are required… the picture starts to change quite a bit.  Once you start hitting the engine-out (or tank drops for fuel pumps) maintenance items, the cost of owning an ICE car starts to increase quite a bit.

My interest in an EV as future replacement for my now 18 year old ICE is partly due to the prospect of avoiding all those maintenance items over a longer time of ownership. Add the ability to self-charge at home in my own drive way, the noise reduction, the lack of exhausts… I’m under no illusion that EVs are going to be the way of the future. 

It doesn’t mean that the little boy in me doesn’t love the roar of a big V8 but … we all gotta grow up sometime I suppose :grinning_face_with_smiling_eyes:.","<div class=""md""><p>Comparing a new (or near new) EV and ICE vehicle isn’t going to give you the full comparison of longer term maintenance costs.</p>

I actually have more respect for those who just say that they like their Hilux/Ranger and will never get an EV, than those who claim obviously wrong misinformation to justify why EVs are bad.

Same with the suspension. I’m keen to know if the suspension changes were a simple retune of the struts/springs, or whether the entire geometry was changed.

"Think I'm going to be keeping my 2008 Outback turbo for a few years yet...

Cost me $10k with 80k km on the clock in May 2020, only has 140k km now, so good for at least another 100k km to 150k km (6  to 10 years). 198 kW, 5 sp auto. FastR app clocks 0-100 in 5.0 seconds (S#, preloading the turbo), tows 1800 kg, averages 8.7-9.3 l/100 km in everyday driving, 8.0 on a trip (did 780 km on a tank once, 750 a couple of other times). It even has freaking EyeSight cruise control that works down to sub-walking speed in traffic, lane departure warning, lead vehicle start alert, auto-braking in cruise control (collision alarm when not in cruise). Missing compared to new cars? Parking sensors and camera, blind spot warning, lane centering. Anything else?

It has some of the lowest EV incentives, and I don't think they have fleet average economy / emission standards.

In somewhere like NZ (once our clean standard kicks in) or Europe. Not only do EV's pick up a big incentive, but their sale allows manufacturers to either reduce their fine / emission credit purchase bill, or allows them to sell additional high margin, high emitting vehicles.

Not really a secret that Europe, UK, China & parts of the USA are gobbling up the bulk of the world EV supply.

Hopefully Honda NZ will allocate some EV's to NZ as we have both a strong EV incentive, and the clean car standard ramping up (fines for automakers who's fleet average is too emitting).

"**Question 1:** 

If it’s 400W for fridge etc, that’s 0.4kW so (baring inefficiencies in the system) could a 24kW Leaf could power that house for 60 hours?

**Jonathan:**

That's roughly the idea, yeah, with a few details sprinkled in. The inverter won't be perfectly efficient, so it loses some energy on the way through. Maybe 90% for a decent one. Same thing with the DC/DC converter. So I'd guess that it takes roughly 25% more power from the battery than makes it to the appliance. So a 400W fridge will use 500W from the main battery.

The 24kWh Leaf lets you use about 22kWh from completely full to completely empty, so that's about 44 hours. Unfortunately, the Leaf also uses a few hundred W to keep itself alive, so that 500W + 300W into the car would be more like 800W and maybe 30 hours from 100% to the car shutting itself down to protect itself.
Another complicating factor is that the fridge likely doesn't draw 400W for long. It'll get cold and then start cycling on and off, for instance, so it can be a challenge to figure out how much it's actually drawing.","<div class=""md""><p><strong>Question 1:</strong> </p>

"**Question 2:**

The part that intrigues me is the DC-DC converter that charges the 12V battery (in the Leaf) - presumably this has a maximum current rating like a conventional alternator would have - and what is that rating? If you’re drawing 100A from it, is the DC-DC converter really able to supply that much, or is that running the 12V battery down?

**Jonathan:**

This is why I recommend checking the battery voltage with a multimeter or, if it has one, the input voltage meter on the inverter.
The DC/DC converter will absolutely have a maximum current and once that's reached, it'll go into current-limit mode and won't supply anything more. At this point, the voltage will start to drop and the battery will start to supply part of the load. This is something you can see pretty clearly, so as long as the voltage is within 'normal' range for a float-charging 12V battery, you're fine.

In my experience, going beyond this (which I've done a few times accidentally and a few more times 'for science') causes the entire situation to collapse and the inverter to disconnect. This is because the load stays the same on the output, so as the voltage drops then the current increases. This causes a positive feedback loop very quickly (within seconds), which causes the battery voltage to drop too far and the inverter to error out. It's not ideal and I'd try to avoid it as a matter of course, but I haven't hurt anything yet, nor do I think it ever would.","<div class=""md""><p><strong>Question 2:</strong></p>

"So Tesla break 7000 sold in a year (putting Tesla into 6th place overall for car sale sin NZ),  BYD has a solid (new sales) 3rd place  with the MG not too far behind.  Also impressed with Polestar hitting 821, thats a solid sales number for an expensive car and manufacturer new to the market.

Leaf is most of the used market at 3586 2nd place model S at 42 then eNV-200 at 35, showing the imported used market is still entirely about leafs

"Z Energy has a set of 3x 200 kW chargers in Ashburton. Possibly they were the fastest ones in the South Island up until now?

Charge speed on those was excellent: I got a solid 180 kW on an Ioniq 5 a few weeks ago.

The Z app experience, however, was terrible! There is no other way to charge except using the Z app, and the Z app is only available on the NZ iOS app store: a huge pain for someone visiting NZ. Luckily I do have an NZ debit card, so I was able to switch to an NZ app store account to download the Z app. But I spent more time messing about with this than it actually took to charge the car! And if I didn't have an NZ debit it might have been impossible?

ChargeNet have got a much better setup where you can use the app but also have the option to pay via web, which can save an awful lot of time and hassle if you don't already have the app. And in Europe it's better again as most chargers now let you just ""pay at pump"" with a contactless credit/debit card.","<div class=""md""><p>Z Energy has a set of 3x 200 kW chargers in Ashburton.
