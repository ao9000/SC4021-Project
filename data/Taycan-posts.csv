Went in as a (mid 20's) guy and just asked to look and the salesman grabbed they keys and sat me in the driver's seat of a CPO 4S right away with no issues.

He could tell I was kind of holding back (the throw on the throttle is much more than my other cars), and encouraged me to give it my all.


What an absolute beauty of a car and drive, the steering is tight and responsive, let alone the speed.

If anything the test drive convinced me to get a base model... The 4s was heart shatteringly fast.

After we got back (and he had me test launch control) he gave me no pressure at all and just gave me a card and sent me on my way. 

10/10 experience.

Not sure why I made this post other than to say I'm in love with this car, and hopefully my career goals pan out because I definitely can't afford it right now XD

I‚Äôve been following this sub as well as Taycanforums obsessively, thinking a GTS ST would be my next car. The car is beautiful in person but the drive was‚Ä¶ not what I expected. For reference, I drive an Alfa Romeo Stelvio QV and used to drive a Porsche Boxster.

1. The interior, in all black GTS spec, is just claustrophobic and drab. I saw a Turbo with chalk that lightened things up a bit. But in all black it did not feel inviting or worth $140k at all.

2. In my head, my main issue is the disconnect between what I perceive to be a nice, analog Porsche driving experience in terms of steering, feedback and ride, and a very digital power plant. The car is fast, violently fast, but there‚Äôs no ‚Äúthrottle response,‚Äù it‚Äôs just push and go. And don‚Äôt even get me started on the Porsche sound. It‚Äôs way too loud and fake sounding when it‚Äôs on, and when it‚Äôs off there‚Äôs just.. nothing. I wish you could turn the volume down on the sound instead of just on or off.

3. I drove this car on probably the worst road in San Diego. The ride was acceptable, but there was an insane amount of tire noise and rock/water noise pinging in the wheel wells/undercarriage. This is something I‚Äôm accustomed to from the Boxster but figured sound insulation would be better in the Taycan.

The Taycan seems to occupy this middle ground between EVs that are made to be appliances and silent bullet trains, and Porsches that are made to be the opposite. My brain can‚Äôt get around the melding of the two. I‚Äôve driven Teslas and electric BMWs that felt just right- silent barges on the road. But the Taycan just felt confused to me. I will probably try driving this car again on better roads.. when it‚Äôs not wet.

In June 2021, I decided to switch it up and got a 2021 Taycan Turbo S.  Absolutely the most thrilling car I've ever owned.

It's been a truly wonderful experience, and until recently my plan was to let the lease expire at the end of this year and roll into a 2025. I'm just waiting for my dealer to accept 2025 build specs. But now it looks like my Porsche experience is going to end on a sour note. I likely won't buy another Porsche.

The car had been running flawlessly. I took it in for a 40,000 mile check which includes tire inflation, wiper fluid, and other routine maintenance. A tiny dent was spotted on the metal plate which protects the HV battery. I'm not sure what caused the dent. Presumably a pothole. Service department said that even a tiny dent means the battery needs to be removed, inspected, and probably replaced. This, despite the fact that the battery is working perfectly fine.

So I trusted them. The battery replacement cost was $48k including parts and labor. My insurance covered it all, less my $1,000 deductible. Money was sent the the dealer.

And there the car sat. No work done whatsoever. **It's been nearly two months now**. It's not as though there's a dispute over costs, labor, money, etc. And it's not as though there's a shortage of specialists. This is one of the nation's largest Porsche dealers / service departments.

They have the cash payment and agree that the battery will be replaced. But they're unable to get the battery shipped from Germany.

The excuses are always along the lines of, ""We're waiting on so and to sign off and release the battery."" It's just bureaucratic silliness.

I've made two lease payments despite not having use of my car. I'm not planning on making a third.

They gave me some crappy housewife Porsche SUV to drive around as a loaner in the meantime.

So that's where I stand. I hired a really good auto lawyer to negotiate on my behalf. Not sure how much he can do though, since he's a lemon law dude and this isn't really a lemon law case. My first meeting with him is on Tuesday of next week. My hope is that he can:

* get Porsche to agree to a suspension of lease payments until lease winds down, or
* get a loaner Taycan Turbo S for me to drive until my lease is up while I continue making lease payments, or
* get the lease canceled with no penalty, in which case I'll be carless for a while, or
* fix the darned car before my next lease payment is due

I also opened a case with Porsche North America. I can already tell that's a dead end. No one is following up, and I doubt they'll be accommodative regarding skipping the lease payments. I'm told that they simply don't care and will ignore you unless you get an attorney involved. I only went down this path to get an official case number for my attorney.

Needless to say, this will be my last Porsche. I'll follow-up on this thread over time and let you know the outcome, just in case any of you find yourself in a similar position, so you'll at least know what to do (or what not to do!) to get compensation.

For what it's worth, the Taycan TS is the most enjoyable car I've ever driven. It's not a quality issue. It's purely a customer service issue. So weird that my relationship with Porsche is ending this way.
