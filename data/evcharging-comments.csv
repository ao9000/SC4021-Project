skaven81,"Kudos on your determination!  That looks like a pretty complex install (I'm assuming you had an electrician do it?) and therefore probably pretty expensive.  But I'm sure totally worth it to be able to charge at home!

I also see you have one of the fancy 1st edition e-trons with dual charging ports...very handy in this case!

I looked up the DCC-9-50A and it looks like its specialty is that it can be placed between the meter and the panel; it looks like it monitors the current from the meter and/or heading to the panel, and will disable the EV charger if the load gets too high (which means it doesn't affect the load rating of the panel, meter, or primary utility feed, as it only utilizes excess capacity that the panel is not using).

It's good to know that such a device exists -- I have some friends and relatives that have similarly difficult environments for setting up L2 charging.

The DCC-9-50A does look similar in purpose to the new Siemens device noted at https://insideevs.com/news/601056/siemens-connectder-money-saving-home-ev-charging-solution/ - did your electrician suggest this one as well as an option?

Most paid L2 chargers will start fining users who leave their cars on the charger when they're full, and no longer charging.  This transition often takes place hours after charging starts. 

At a hotel, this will often be in the middle of the night, and getting up to move the car an extreme inconvenience for the car owner.

A hotel where I have to get up in the wee hours and move the car to a non-charger spot would make the charger, and the hotel, much less attractive.

eepluribus,"It's part of a 5-location pilot program by 7-11. We have one here in Sarasota, FL as well. The units advertize as 180kw, however it's a split supply charger, and they max out at 90kw per connector, regardless if both or 1 is in use. 

Reliability has been very good at the Sarasota location and its nice having amenities like a bathroom and convenience store, as well as a waffle house and Wendy's right next door, which is more than a lot of other dcfc stations out there. 

Charging cost at launch was $0.59/kw but they quickly lowered it to 0.35 to match the going rate in FL. 

As someone who inherently wants to talk about the car I drive (I'm in sales), it's kinda cool to just hang out at my car and let people ask questions. People still don't even know that brands other than Tesla make EVs, simply because they have no interaction with them.

There should probably be an EV etiquette infographic handed out to people that buy EVs.

ToddA1966,"Absolutely agree. I'm a 6'' 3"", 280 pound, 57 year old white man, so I don't have the same level of concern personally, but would I want my wife or my daughters charging at some if the sketchy places I've charged? Hell, no.

Not only should you just be able to tap to pay with Apple, Google, credit cards, or whatever, I think the chargers should just start charging the second you plug in, and if you haven't sorted out the payment within say, 2, 3, or 5 minutes, or whatever, then it times out, stops charging, and makes you pay before it will restart. This way, you could plug in, get in your car, lock the doors, and *then* download/setup whatever stupid app/website/magic incantation is required to pay that charger's operator. 

Sure, the charging company might lose $0.50 or $1 if you grabbed your free 2 minutes of charging without paying, but frankly that's on them for not making it easier to pay! :beaming_face_with_smiling_eyes:

I&#39;m a 6&#39;&#39; 3&quot;, 280 pound, 57 year old white man, so I don&#39;t have the same level of concern personally, but would I want my wife or my daughters charging at some if the sketchy places I&#39;ve charged? Hell, no.</p>

<p>Not only should you just be able to tap to pay with Apple, Google, credit cards, or whatever, I think the chargers should just start charging the second you plug in, and if you haven&#39;t sorted out the payment within say, 2, 3, or 5 minutes, or whatever, then it times out, stops charging, and makes you pay before it will restart. This way, you could plug in, get in your car, lock the doors, and <em>then</em> download/setup whatever stupid app/website/magic incantation is required to pay that charger&#39;s operator. </p>

<p>Sure, the charging company might lose $0.50 or $1 if you grabbed your free 2 minutes of charging without paying, but frankly that&#39;s on them for not making it easier to pay! :beaming_face_with_smiling_eyes:</p>

RickS50,"Just a mention, since you're charging Tesla's, their charging equipment has built in temperature sensors in the plug and it would not have let this happen. It would have throttled the charging rate way down and you would have had a difficult time actually getting the cars charged, but I'd rather have that than what you had happen.

Since your EVSE's plug is now compromised, if you can convert it to a hard wire I'd say go that route. Hopefully you can find a point that the wire is not damaged and make a connection to that point. Unfortunately it might entail going a few feet up the wall and adding an additional box with a cover plate.

If the Siemens was damaged where you need a new charger, I highly recommend the new Tesla Wall Connector as it does both NACS and J1772. Added bonus is you can get more of them down the road and they can be told to share the same line so they automatically throttle the car.

put_tape_on_it,"That's pretty great.  Hope it starts a trend.

I'd absolutely pay $2-3 extra per day for EV long term parking that had 12 amp L1 chargers, even if I had to walk to the far end of the parking lot for that privilege of paying more.  Totally worth it for a worry free trip, knowing that the car's plugged in and will be ready for me whenever I get back.   Bonus that ICE vehicles would never enter the lot, so tampering would probably be less.

At the far end of the parking lot, a 3 phase 150 KVA 120/208 transformer could provide a 400 amp service to a panel that could power about 80 spots, with no fancy power sharing.

As it scaled up to more and more spots, and a larger and larger percentage of vehicles would spend most of their time not actually charging past for first 24-48 hours, the economics of a power sharing setup would make more and more sense.  Cars would plug in, would max it out for a day or 3, then taper off. Average long term parking is 5-7 days, so long term EV L1 park-charging, on average, would only half half of it's allocated amps utilized, amp wise. (until the one day it wasn't, and it popped something. And that's why any over subscription of charging power would require active power sharing!)

The charging is primarily meant for them so this isn’t a complaint but I noticed that I could park in a spot close to them and reach my vehicle when their cars were fully charged and sitting there. Thus to someone else it would appear that they parked in the spot just to block it when that wasn’t the case.

Accurate_Flatworm_11,"See the missing breakers at slot 13/14? That hole should have covers on it (and no, not duct tape) per National Electric Code. Even if it was a good panel it would not pass an electrical inspection because of that. Your landlord had a city rental property inspection, not an electrical inspection. You can check with your city’s electrical inspector, just ask him if he would pass a Federal Pacific panel with Stab-Lok breakers or fail it. Your local fire inspector may also have information.

You could call a Home Performance weatherization contractor and pay him to scan the electric panel with an infrared camera while all loads are turned on. If he sees any hot spots, have him snap an IR picture, turn off all the loads immediately. Share the picture with your landlord. If you share it with the electrical inspector, he’ll just kill the power and red tag the panel until it’s replaced, not a good path if you want to stay on good terms with your landlord.

All that being said, if the panel was repaired with new guts or completely replaced, you then perform a load calculation per NEC. Then it would come down to the charger rating on the EV you’re looking to buy. Most that use a 120V outlet don’t draw more than 12A, some older brands only draw 6A. It’ll be slow charging, probably adding 3-8 miles of range for each hour of charging.

theotherharper,"Good grief people.  This is a subpanel in a garage on a cinder block wall.  It's surface mounted and I see 2 Romex coming out of it. So it was previously somewhere else and was recycled to be a garage subpanel. The breaker schedule is wrong and that's a code violation, that's the only reason we're confused.

FPE's problems are grossly, insanely exaggerated in [pure moral panic](https://www.oxfordreference.com/display/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803100208829), as usual, driven by popular media coverage.  Just like people think asbestos is plutonium because of all the lawyer ads. (which are just to find victims for an easy job cashing in on the mesothelioma trust funds).  Yet people think they're going to die because of asbestos hardboard covered in 5 coats of paint. Good grie, just try to resist the urge to grind it up and huff it.

So they generally have 2 problems of concern, #1 is bus stab burn-up because the unique ""Stab-Lok"" was good enough to pass UL, but has a higher-incidence of burn-ups.   But here we are on a cinder block wall, I would maybe add a fireblock so in case the sheet of plywood catches, it doesn't set the ceiling on fire. Sheet of drywall for instance.

And #2 is that the 2-pole breakers tend to fail to trip, because their internal common-trip mechanism will ""tram"" or wedge itself.  And there's an easy answer there, for a 240V only (no neutral) load, use two singles and a handle-tie.  Or a new-build breaker, which I suspect is imported from Canada, where FPE panels are accepted and supported by Schneider/Square D.  I have no doubt that CSA has given these breakers careful scrutiny given the drama south of the border.

So I think OP is fine.  I would do a hardwired wall unit with a written agreement that you take it with you when you leave.  Set the wall unit for whatever speed [satisfies your needs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iyp_X3mwE1w&t=1695s).","<div class=""md""><p>Good grief people.

Just like people think asbestos is plutonium because of all the lawyer ads. (which are just to find victims for an easy job cashing in on the mesothelioma trust funds).  Yet people think they&#39;re going to die because of asbestos hardboard covered in 5 coats of paint. Good grie, just try to resist the urge to grind it up and huff it.</p>

<p>So they generally have 2 problems of concern, #1 is bus stab burn-up because the unique &quot;Stab-Lok&quot; was good enough to pass UL, but has a higher-incidence of burn-ups.   But here we are on a cinder block wall, I would maybe add a fireblock so in case the sheet of plywood catches, it doesn&#39;t set the ceiling on fire. Sheet of drywall for instance.</p>

<p>And #2 is that the 2-pole breakers tend to fail to trip, because their internal common-trip mechanism will &quot;tram&quot; or wedge itself.  And there&#39;s an easy answer there, for a 240V only (no neutral) load, use two singles and a handle-tie.  Or a new-build breaker, which I suspect is imported from Canada, where FPE panels are accepted and supported by Schneider/Square D.  I have no doubt that CSA has given these breakers careful scrutiny given the drama south of the border.</p>

<p>So I think OP is fine.  I would do a hardwired wall unit with a written agreement that you take it with you when you leave.  Set the wall unit for whatever speed <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iyp_X3mwE1w&amp;t=1695s"">satisfies your needs</a>.</p>

The proper answer to the OP is that the FPE panel in question is not a suitable host for a new EVSE circuit, but the good news is a modern 4 load panel is roughly $150 and the installation appears straightforward.  At that point you might as well put in a 50A circuit, but you'd likely do fine at 40A 30A or even 20A.  If you want to charge at L1 (120V) be my guest on the old panel, but it's likely not a satisfying experience.","<div class=""md""><p>So much opinion in posts on this topic.So little information.Let&#39;s go to the one, now 80 year old, engineer who actually tested hundreds of breakers from that style of panel:<a href=""https://inspectapedia.com/fpe/FPE-Hazards-Aronstein-2017-11-10.pdf"">https://inspectapedia.com/fpe/FPE-Hazards-Aronstein-2017-11-10.pdf</a></p>

customdev,"Federal Pacific is long out of business. I've experienced an arc flash off their older 480V 3 phase equipment and lived to tell the tale but there's a few things that I'd think about.

1. The panel is old and the parts are not made by the OEM. At 40 I'd suggest replacing any panel based on age alone.

2. 150 amps is a little undersized for service if you plan to charge an EV and the rest of your house has heavy electrical draws from heating or cooling applications. Consider a service upgrade if available and cost effective. Do a load audit and run the calculations.

3. An EV is not an intermittent current draw like your dryer, an electric furnace, stove, or water heater. It's a constant draw that can create a great deal of heat in a panel over several hours of charge time. That said you'd really want to think about how much heat you could potentially generate if the breaker is undersized, the connections in that panel are not secured, or if you get something breaker wise that sticks.

Last note I'd do a hardwired charger install instead of a 14-50 plug. Plug in chargers and cheap receptacles are known to go up in smoke.

I suggest a minimum of a 6/3 copper conductor with ground. Properly installed and bushed MC or LFMC based on location would be entirely appropriate.","<div class=""md""><p>Federal Pacific is long out of business.

SirEDCaLot,"I read this invoice as-  

'Customer hired me to deliver 80 gallons of propane to their 120 gallon propane tank via the 2"" propane refilling port and expected to pay $350 for this.  I instead invoiced them for delivering 400 gallons of nacho cheese spread to their flower pot via the power socket with a total bill of $5,000.  They say they are unhappy with this invoice, but I'll have to investigate why.'  

So let's dive in...  

1. There's no such thing as 350kW CHAdeMO.  It literally doesn't exist.  CHAdeMO maxes out at 50kW currently, there's a spec for like 150kW but nobody adopts it because nobody makes a CHAdeMO car that can handle more than 50kW and the connector has no future so nobody's developing anything for it except the CHAdeMO association.  
2. The Mach.E has an 88kWh battery meaning even if you pull in with literally 0% charge and fill to 100%, you'll at most use maybe 90kWh, perhaps 100kWh if you run the AC on full blast the whole time.  So it's very unlikely a Mach.E would consume 125kw in a charge session.  
3. 13 min 37 sec is 0.23 hours.  Even assuming you're going at the supposed connector full rate of 350 kW- 350kW times 0.23 hours is 80.5 kWh.  That is the maximum amount of energy a 350kW connector can transfer in 13:37.  
4. To transfer 125 kWh via a 350kW connection, assuming it's going at full rate the entire time, you'll need about 36 minutes.  To transfer 125kW in 13 mins 37 sec, you will need a transfer rate of 544 kW.  No charging station currently offers that, and no car on the market can accept that.  
5. It says max charging speed was 161kW- multiple that by .23 and you get a maximum possible transfer of 37kWh, assuming the car stayed at the max rate of 161kW the entire time it was plugged in.  

In short- for multiple different reasons, this invoice is literally not physically possible.","<div class=""md""><p>I read this invoice as-  </p>

There are ways to tweak how you're charged. If you have 2 EVs, it might be advantageous to select the cheap night tariff. You'd pay something like 4 cents per kWh overnight, but the price during the day would become higher. If you charge at night, this could put you up ahead.  
However, I'm only granny charging a single Ioniq classic, and I've calculated that all 3 options of how electric is charged, ends up about the same.  
But I'm still exploring solar panels, to future proof, and to see if I could do it for fun. Instead of a roof installation, I'm considering a DIY in the yard using 2x4 cheap wood, and get a 1 to 2 kW setup going. This could in theory make driving the Ioniq nearly free.  
I'd also feed the power into the house and create a plug inside, because why not.

cowboyjosh2010,"Pittsburgh, PA, metro area: a total of about $0.14/kWh for residential electricity from October to April, and about $0.19/kWh for the same from April to October.  (AKA Winter electricity is cheaper than summer electricity here.)  These are averages across my whole electricity bill, and would be different if I used electricity differently throughout the day than I currently do, as I am on a time-of-use pricing system.  If I did the bulk of my EV charging in the afternoons, each of these figures would be probably 3 - 5 cents/kWh higher.

Breaking that out, we have supply, transmission, and distribution rates which contribute to those seasonal averages.  It is the distribution rate which fluctuates seasonally, causing the ~$0.05/kWh difference from winter to summer.

I've been meticulously tracking the details of my electricity bill over the past 3 years and have noticed a trend whereby electricity goes up ~$0.02/kwh for a given month from one year to the next.  Each contributor to my electric rate changes every now and again--sometimes going up, sometimes going down--and the net result of all changes tends to be about an annual increase of $0.02/kWh.

Lastly I'll note that I have ""time of use"" pricing structure on the ""Supply"" rate.  This is a program I have access to as an EV owner.  1PM - 9PM is peak, 9-11PM, as well as 6AM-1PM, is off-peak, and 11PM - 6AM is super off-peak.  Both off-peak and super off-peak are cheaper than the standard Supply rate charged when you're not on a time of use pricing system, and peak is more expensive than the standard Supply rate:

Peak: $0.112/kWh

Standard: $0.105/kWh

Off-Peak: $0.071/kWh

Super Off-Peak: $0.051/kWh

So, the super off-peak supply rate is just shy of half of the peak supply rate.  If you add the time-of-use-dependent Supply rate to my fixed rates for Distribution and Transmission, you get the following:

Total electricity rate charged during...

Peak (1-9PM): $0.172/kWh

Standard (non time of use pricing): $0.165/kWh

Off-peak (6AM - 1PM; 9PM - 11PM): $0.131/kWh

Super off-peak (11PM - 6AM): $0.111/kWh

fozzie_was_here,"I’d say yes, with as much info as I could guess from your post. 

I’d want more information about the $1,450. Sounds like that’s part of a transformer or building-wide service upgrade. Your coop may be planning for future capacity or your current infrastructure is old or under-spec. That kind of sucks but if they’ve had an electrical survey done, it may be necessary. I’d ask for a copy of whatever documentation they have that’s driving that. 

$3k for an EVSE and installation if that includes up to 150ft of conduit and wiring or whatever, that isn’t unreasonable. Especially if it involves trenching or concrete work. Do you then own the EVSE? Is this metered off your private meter with like a DCC-9? Or is it like a ChargePoint setup where you have to pay every time you charge?

Legal fees…IDK but if the charger is on deeded property (i.e., your private parking space) then perhaps this is necessary. 

If this becomes legally *your* charger tied to *your* property, then there is value as a property improvement. For a future buyer of your condo who wants a charger, they may pay a premium.","<div class=""md""><p>I’d say yes, with as much info as I could guess from your post. </p>

mouwallace,Still waiting (3 months now) for the legal fee to register the charger on title but I’m expecting $800-1000 CDN (in Ontario) for that. We didn’t require any electrical upgrades so the $1450 per unit sounds very reasonable given some quotes we had if we were going to have to upgrade. There’s likely management fees sewn into the $3K for the charger including installation but ours was $1700 including tax so the variability is probably in the actual charger. A Chargepoint unit would have run at least $2300-2500.  So I think you’re in good shape with what they’ve quoted.,"<div class=""md""><p>Still waiting (3 months now) for the legal fee to register the charger on title but I’m expecting $800-1000 CDN (in Ontario) for that.

SGoon85,"Mine was a little over $6 800 in Montreal.

The price included a DCC 9, trenching, 18m of cable, screw pile, Wallbox Eiffel solo pedistal, Wallbox Pulsar Plus, some grass seed, a piping coupler because they accidentally knicked a sprinkler line, and all the miscellaneous hardware (screws, support brackets, etc).

Installed in front of my parking spot for personal use outdoors. I’m the only one on my street to have an EVSE probably due to the price and complexity (all parking is outdoors and requires some sort of trenching, luckily I did not require going through asphalt).

There is a provincial rebate program here in Quebec that is different than from homes to help takeaway some of the sting.","<div class=""md""><p>Mine was a little over $6 800 in Montreal.</p>

JamesthePuppy,"Adding to the chorus that this seems reasonable. My building (in Toronto) is currently undergoing this process. I’ve had an EV for 5 years now, but I guess better late than never. Our breakdown:

Infrastructure cost is being covered by the operating fund, estimated at $170,000 for ~18 chargers in a ~400 unit building. They’re applying for a ZEVIP grant to help cover this. This will obviously belong to the building

EVSE + installation is estimated to be $2,250-2,950, including a 10% bulk installation discount. I’m BYO, so that’ll hopefully knock down the price. Either way, these will belong to the respective owners. They’re running conduit and wire to every spot though, so this cost subsidizes installation for other residents. But I felt a responsibility to show interest, lest they cancel the project altogether

They’re not charging a legal fee, which worries me a bit. They are using a managed option that includes upstream load sharing and billing, so $10/mo management fee + electricity costs at market + 1 time registration fee of $250","<div class=""md""><p>Adding to the chorus that this seems reasonable.

theotherharper,"It really depends on how they're doing it. Since you have your own electric meter and your own deeded parking spot, I'm extremely partial to the solution where they put a feeder tap on your own electric meter and run modest sized wire from there to your parking spot.  That way the EV electric cost simply shows up on your normal electric bill.  This involves more wire running, but is cheaper than all the weird and ongoing costs of a separate power distribution just for the EV stations, where then they have to put metering on each station, and bill you separately. The costs on that get CRAZY out of hand. 

The other thing is, most people don't want to wait a year for a larger transformer.  This can be solved with Load Management/EVEMS two ways. First with a master system for all EVs, so when the complex is at heavy load, all EV charging stops.  Second with a system on your local apartment which SLOWS or stops EV charging when your apartment is using power heavily.  So if you run a dryer load, EV charging slows from 5kW to 2kW etc. Difference being, your finger is on that control - if you want to charge at full speed, abstain from large appliance use.  

The last system needs significant down-factoring e.g. if your unit has a 100A panel, it may only have 45A of capacity out at the transformer, and it must be tuned down further for provisioning reasons, perhaps to 30A. But still, with your large appliances off, that's 25A or so to the car or 6kW. 

Anyway to your question about pricing - the shared infrastructure cost is very reasonable IMO.  $3k for a charging station (we're talking a Wallbox and 75 cent/foot wires added to the existing infrastructure) is highway robbery.    The $1000 is a junk fee, of course.  Some marketing genius, probably in the company they're working with, contrived this number as ""one EV owners are likely to pay"". And that feels right for that purpose, ours in America are $4000-5000 of Yankeeloonies.","<div class=""md""><p>It really depends on how they&#39;re doing it.

We don't necessarily need more DC ""fast"" chargers in cities. We need DC really fast chargers along highways.

Look at e.g. Brownsville, TX. Closest (edit CCS) DCFC is in Corpus Christi. You can't really drive to South Padre Island and back on DCFC. (360 miles roundtrip)

There are DCfC in Brownsville, but they are all at dealerships, and often busy, blocked, not accessible or plain broken. In the best case you sit an hour at a dealership. Just read reviews on Plugshare. But if there were proper DCFC stations along 281 and 77 and 83, things would be easier.

In terms of action, you get the quickest results driving a Tesla and giving Tesla money to build more DCFC. 2 out of 3 DCFC built in the US are Tesla, and they are all 250kW+, no 50kW DCfC. They build more than everybody else together.

Slower, but also important is lobbying your governments (and voting for candidates/parties that support EVs). Not the ones who e.g. take credit for IRA subsidies but voted against the IRA.

Librekrieger,"It's both range AND infrastructure. The threshold of which routes are feasible is determined by the car's range, its charging technology, and layout of the charging network the car can use.

My commuter car, a Ford Focus EV with 80 miles of range and max 6.6KW charging, can never do more than maybe 200 miles a day. Even that would require hours-long breaks during the trip. It would be agonizing. Going to a destination 500 miles away and returning home is never going to happen - it would take three long days each way of mostly waiting for the car to charge. Better to rent an ICE for two days.

On the other end of the spectrum, a Tesla can go on a continuous road trip virtually anywhere in the US and Canada, recharging at superchargers, and any reasonable route will have a supercharger well before you run out the range you get between 10% and 80%. You can get something like 250-400 miles of charge per hour of charging, meaning that you could drive 200 miles at a time, taking a couple of 45-minute breaks and recharging overnight, and thus easily and comfortably do 600 miles a day. (I didn't believe it, but a review of the charging network on Plugshare will make this clear. I did that yesterday after arguing the point with a Tesla owner.)

If your more modern non-Tesla vehicle has 200+ mile range and fast charging, you can still do road trips but you have to understand the state of the charging network between you and your destination. They're not as fast on average as a Supercharger, they're not as strategically located, and they are frequently in a nonfunctional state (like many of the Blink chargers near me.)

All that to say, range IS vital to the equation, but we've passed the threshold on that - 80 miles is not enough for trips, but 250  miles is. Infrastructure is equally important; Tesla has solved this. The other providers are doing well, every year it gets better, and it's already good enough to make travel feasible. We don't need chargers every 30 miles, though that's nice and I expect it to happen. But we do need them to work reliably and we need them to have capacity (numbers) to handle ever more EV's on the road.","<div class=""md""><p>It&#39;s both range AND infrastructure. The threshold of which routes are feasible is determined by the car&#39;s range, its charging technology, and layout of the charging network the car can use.</p>

613_detailer,"What the OP describes as ideal does exist near me, in the province of Quebec (Canada).  Practically every little village has a few DCFC, and they are plentiful along major highways.  Most are 100kW or 150kW, which is not too bad considering most EVs can only draw more than that at very low SoC. And lo and behold, they are almost never down.

In Quebec, the electric utility is publicly owned by the provincial government, and they also build and operate the main charging network (named Electric Circuit).  They are not operated with the goal of making a profit, but rather to support the transition to EVs.  The provincial government went all-in on EVs, with large incentives on vehicles, and also invested in the charging network though the public electric utility so that drivers that make the move can feel confident driving on Quebec roads.  EVs now represent over 22% of new car sales in Quebec, so clearly the strategy is working.  The DCFC network might become profitable down the road when a certain threshold of EVs in passed, but in the meantime it's taking a loss for the public good.  In a sense, Tesla operated the same way in the early days.  They took a loss on Superchargers knowing it was necessary in order to sell cars, and they probably have enough on the road using the chargers to at least break even now.

That's why a this early stage, a privately-operated charging network will never meet the need in low-density areas.  The timeline to profit if far too long, and there is no intangible benefit for a charging network company that does not sell cars or isn't a government pursuing a policy objective.  The Ionna initiative may solve this by pooling the ressources of many manufacturers, but automakers will at least need to make a profit on the EVs themselves before they accept to take a loss on the charging network during ramp-up.

In addition, the common use-case of the half of all people who can't charge at home (and presumably most don't want to have to go to a charger every single day) has to be accounted for and they would prefer not to have to stop as often as they do today.

theotherharper,"The problem is, the places you need DC fast chargers, you're not a citizen/resident and the local government has no reason to listen to you.  

Let's say you're driving from Salt Lake to Omaha.   You need DC fast chargers in 

* Kimball Junction, UT (not a big ask, huge skiing and residential area), 
* A wide spot in the road called Emory, where the main attraction in town is a railroad siding. 
* Evanston, Wyoming (already got one) 
* Along the freeway near Fort Bridger/Lyman area, but on the freeway
* Little America, Wyoming (fantastic place for one since it's a literal attraction like Wall Drug; can't imagine why LA hasn't put some in) 
* Green River/Rock Springs area
* Point of Rocks, Wyoming, a tiny little town
* Wamsutter, WY, another tiny town (and this is a 45 mile gap on both sides, farther than you said; there's just nothing else out here)
* Rawlins, WY (both EA and Tesla stations here) 
* Two stops in the literal middle of nowhere along I-80 in the Medicine Bow national forest
* Laramie, WY
* (big 50 minute gap unless you want ANOTHER middle of nowhere stop) 
* 50 miles to Cheyenne, WY, which has quite a few, but on the backside of town far from I-80
* 42 miles to the small town of Pine Bluffs WY
* 32 miles to the small town of Dix, NE, a few hundred people and a Minuteman silo
* 28 miles to Sidney, NE, a respectable size town
* 45 miles to Juleburg, CO at the 80/76 split (good place for one) 
* Olgalla, NE
* North Platte, NE 
* The towns get thicker here as Nebraska gets more urbanized, and you start hitting towns like Kearney, Grand Island, Lincoln etc. that have the funding to think about DCFCs. 

Hop on Google Earth and look at the towns we're talking about. Go ahead and start your letter writing campaign, but a DCFC would probably cost a couple times their annual town budget.   And why would they put them in for you?  The most their town will get out of it is sale of some pork rinds and a slurpee. And some like Lyman or Grand Island are far enough off the freeway that you'd pass them up anyway.

LastEntertainment684,"My Lightning in the summer gets about 250 miles of range with the 20% buffer. Pulling a trailer in the winter though, I’ve seen as low as 105 miles. 

A V8 gas F150 goes from around 500 miles in summer to about 250 miles pulling a trailer in winter.

Based on my experience, I’ve found 250 miles of range seems to work pretty well. I can comfortably manage on trips in an ICE or EV truck. Stops work out to about when I want to pee and/or eat anyway. 

The 105 miles of range though, is a killer. Stopping every hour and a half or so to charge for ~30 minutes just gets to be obnoxious and anxiety inducing. 

So yes, more chargers would help the overwhelming majority of EVs, but range is definitely a factor for some vehicles and applications.

SHDrivesOnTrack,"Couple of things to consider (but not really a solution to the issue)

The location of the chargers may have been chosen next to the elevator because that's the easiest way to add circuits and a conduit run to the nearest breaker panel.   I would agree that chargers in undesirable parking spots tends to lessen the casual usage (and ICEing) of the spot. 

You mention that there are multiple companies that share the building.  If this is the case, the issue may be in part that the building owner/landlord is not the same group as the tenant/your-employer.   It might be worth figuring out who owns the EV charging and parking first, as that is probably the most important issue. 

Perhaps you might consider doing an informal survey of the parking lot a few days over a month and count the number of EVs vs ICE cars.     This might be useful to share with the other tenants, e.g. 10% of the cars in the parking lot are EVs or PHEV.   Tenants could push back when negotiating their next lease with additional provisions for ""5% of parking spots with 4kw charging or better.""   

You may also have to settle for non-dedicated EV parking spots; if the parking lot is full-ish, management won't want a lot of empty EV spots when people who aren't charging still need to park.   I've seen this where there were 6 or so dedicated charging spots in the lot , later they added one charger on each of the support columns with long enough cords that could reach 4 non-dedicated parking spots.  That provided some level of flexibility. 

You might check to see if the local utility has some rebates or programs for discounted charging that ties into time-of-use billing.   Some Utilities have a glut of solar PV power early in the afternoon, and then run into a deficit early evening when everyone goes home and turns on the AC.   Some utilities are experimenting with EV chargers that can be remotely deactivated by the utility when power is in high demand.   People can charge at a discount rate from 9a to 3p, and then the charger may shut down depending on demand.   Some utilities are providing rebates for equipment and discounted electric rates for this.   If such programs are available in your area, it might offset the cost of adding additional chargers. 

Lastly, others have commented, having a token fee to charge would weed out some of the cars that don't really need to charge.  It would still be super helpful to people who can't charge at home to get $0.10/kwh at work, but as a person who can charge at home, I would probably not bother, if the cost to charge at work and home was about the same.","<div class=""md""><p>Couple of things to consider (but not really a solution to the issue)</p>

[deleted],"You think charging is more expensive then gas, have you compared the price between EV and Gas versions of the same car (or a rough equivalent, like say a Honda Accord vs a Model 3)? You are looking at roughly a 8-10k price delta to go EV over Gas, even if you had free charging from solar panels at your house you would still take like 7-10 years of the typical driving at current gas prices just to bring the cost of ownership of the Honda up to the purchase price of the EV. I ran the numbers and went with a Honda Civic 3-4 years ago.

I also looked at the 1 fast charge option we had in town and did the same MPG vs. Kwh comparison then and it was more expensive to fast charge then fuel for the civic.

The simple fact is the CAFE standards have made modern cars too energy efficient that they are cheaper to own over the typical ownership span of 7-10 years that it's hard to make the financial argument as a reason to own an EV.","<div class=""md""><p>You think charging is more expensive then gas, have you compared the price between EV and Gas versions of the same car (or a rough equivalent, like say a Honda Accord vs a Model 3)?

dwroushey,"Mine just caught fire so spectacularly that I have no idea what state the bolts were in. I opened it up at the request of customer support and it's not pretty. The pics over in the ID4 forum look tame in comparison.

[https://imgur.com/a/zrii4mp](https://imgur.com/a/zrii4mp)

The entire inside is black with soot. There were molten bits of metal rattling around and 2 of the contacts on the outlet side are melted so bad you can't even tell there used to be screws.

I ordered a portable EVSE from amazon to get me by, but that's giving an unhelpful red error light so I'm worried my 14-50 outlet was also messed up. I shut off the breaker and my electrician is coming out to look at it to be on the safe side.

Thank god my EV's onboard charger seems un damaged. It's charging (slowly) at 120v for now.

Support have already approved a replacement but honestly not sure I even want risk using it since the OP over at the ID4 forum had 2 in a row fail. I feel lucky my house didn't burn down.

theotherharper,"OK, it starts with your NEC Article 220 electric service load calculation.   You choose different strategies depending on if you have loads of surplus capacity, versus, if you are fully subscribed from machines that are used intermittently.  EV charging can squeeze into the holes left by machines used intermittently. 

Start by thinking about how much power your employees need.  Need being different than want.  Ordinarily I would just say ""give them level 1, which is 1.4 kW per station"", but in light of many being apartments, I would double that to 3 kW or even 4 kW per station.  

Charger drama sucks.  Stations are cheap, employee bandwidth is expensive. You do not want employees taking 10 minute breaks out of their day and coordinating with other employees to move cars around, merely because there are too few stations. Let the stations do that automatically, using kit called Power Sharing. If you have 10 stations sharing 20 kW, then then with 2 cars each gets 10kW, with 3 cars each gets 6.66kW, with 4 cars each gets 5kW, 5 cars each gets 4kW, etc.  And as cars finish, the power is spread among hte remaining cars. 

If you have loads of extra capacity, then you can simply provision power.  Now I recommend using Power Sharing, as discussed, at around 2kW or 2.5 kW per car. That's because through the day, cars will be finishing, speeding up the charge of the remaining cars. As such, Power Sharing is much more powerful than you would expect.  

If you are fully subscribed but have intermittent loads (looking at you, air conditioner), then you can do EVEMS / Load Management. Suppose you have an A/C circuit that draws 5 kW when running.  You pair that with an EV station (possibly: Power Sharing group of stations) that puts ""CT clamp meters"" on the circuit wires. When the A/C ramps up, the EV station detects that and slows down charging so the circuit is not overloaded.    You can pretty much pair 1 EV station to any intermittent load like this. If you get into Power Sharing, you'll want the current setting to be higher than your 3-4 kW target, to allow for the duty cycle of the machinery.   We don't currently have a good list of American EV stations that can do BOTH load management AND power sharing at the same time.   Europe has this in the Wallbox Pulsar Plus.","<div class=""md""><p>OK, it starts with your NEC Article 220 electric service load calculation.

[deleted],"Check out the FLO Core+ or Core+ MAX. Both have PowerSharing, so you can install up to 4 chargers on a single circuit/breaker and share the power across all 4 chargers. If only one is plugged in, then that vehicle can get maximum power; if 4 are plugged in, each gets 25% power. This future-proofs you pretty well; you could put, say, 4 chargers on 4 circuits for now (1 per circuit), then in the future add another dozen chargers and have 16 across 4 circuits.

If you're interested message me. I can put you in touch with someone who can figure it all out with you.","<div class=""md""><p>Check out the FLO Core+ or Core+ MAX.

putinhuylo99,"Go with two ChargePoint CP6000 stations, two plugs each so people can charge up to four cars at the same time. ChargePoint builds quality products as you can see for yourself from YouTube reviews, I find them much more reliable and easier to use than other chargers, and you can set the price you charge for electricity to anything you like, even free.

There are two dual plug options.

Option 1: Power Share - meaning if one car plugged in, it can charge up to 80 AMP, but if two cars are plugged in, they split the AMP between the cars up to 40 each. So you will deliver up to 80 AMP total.

Option 2: Standard power - up to 72 AMP each car separately. So you would deliver up to 144 AMP total.

FYI, Teslas can charge at up to 11 kw, meaning at 240 volt they would take at most 46 AMP.

Assuming Power Share is cheaper, I think it is sufficient. With an 8 hour workday, assuming 240 volt 40 AMP PowerShare per car, they would get practically a full charge during their work day without a need for Standard Power. You can set the maximum AMP lower if you don't want too much load on your electrical.

You can find more technical stuff here:

AEM_High,"It’s great you are looking at this incentive for staff. Do you have a budget and plan for how many you are thinking. Plan for future growth in EV adoption and maintenance with stations being out of service (sadly when a station goes down it is often not an overnight fix). If you don’t have the budget right now to install extra chargers consider having the conduit tubing for future stations being dug with this first round. 

I would suggest smart chargers as depending on your companies desires can set rules through the charger. Sadly EV charging is a little of the Wild West for how people utilize them, smart chargers can implement idling fees, access restriction, charges for extended use and waiting lists. Then you only have to worry about someone icing the parking spot. Consider HR policies as someone one day is going to have an issue. 

ChargePoint has a bunch of models likely well suited for your needs that are free standing for a parking lot. You would want to do Level 2 charging, DCFC is not cost effective especially if you will have employees parked for the whole day. While J1772 is loosing market share in the coming years to NACS(Tesla) that is still a couple years away and currently Teslas come with the J1772 adapter. Almost all cars currently on the road other than Tesla are J1772. When talking with ChargePoint see if their units will be upgradeable for NACS cables down the line for future proofing purposes or get a handful or NACS and J1772. You will know what percentage of your employee cars are currently Tesla vs other manufacturers with future state moving to more NACS. But people will likely have those cars for several more years. 

Does ERCOT have any programs or rebates?

I would argue 32-40amps chargers would be ideal as that can help ensure full charge during a typical 8 day if you are trying to provide a perk for employees that live in apartments without alternative charging.

SirEDCaLot,"Interesting.  Once Ford did it, it was only logical that GM follows suit.  

Right now, charging is the Achilles Heel of the American market EV.  Tesla Superchargers work GREAT, just plug in and it works every time.  And when they break, they get fixed right away.  

OTOH, EVERY non-Tesla EV is currently hamstrung by infrastructure.  Try to take a non-Tesla EV on a road trip and you'll get a mess of apps to pay for charging, stations that don't charge at the rated speed or don't work at all, multiple attempts to start a charge session, etc.  
And when it works- each brand has their own process.  It's not like a gas pump (swipe card, select grade, refuel) some you plug in then hit the app, some you hit the app then plug in, some you scan a QR code, etc.  And sometimes when it doesn't work it's user error, sometimes charger error.  For non-techies, this is a problem that stops mass adoption.  

And it's a problem that EVERY other car company is hamstrung by.  If you ever go on road trips, right now a Tesla makes far more sense than any other if only because Supercharging works.  

**I think it's fair to call it right now- NACS probably just won the standard war.**  Ford and GM will both integrate their own car app with Tesla's billing system, so those cars will be plug & charge at any Supercharger without ever making a Tesla account.  

Right now, nobody can beat that.  Even VW/Audi, who are basically in charge of EA, can barely get plug & charge to work right.  And even if that software got unfucked tomorrow, there's more Superchargers (in both sites and stalls) than every other network combined.  VW would have to double or triple their investment in EA to get anywhere near the amount of infrastructure Tesla has.  

This is also going to mean a lot of pressure on charger manufacturers (ABB, Signet, BTC, ChargePoint, etc) to greatly reduce the complexity and cost of their hardware, increase integration (fewer sub-assemblies and modules), and make the units faster to deploy with less labor.  And of course unfuck their software.  Because now they're competing with Tesla, whereas before they were only competing with each other.","<div class=""md""><p>Interesting.

thegoodnamesaregone6,">180kw each, or 90kw if 2 cars are plugged in.

Not exactly.

IIRC it supports charging a single EV at 200amp or two EVs each at 100amp (200a total).

Watts = amps &times; volts

To reach full speed (180 kW or 2x90 kW) it needs cars that charge at 900v.

However most EVs charge at 400v with some high-end ones at 800v. Very few cars support 900v.

That means that the actual speeds are ~80 kW for 400v EVs and ~160 kW for 800v EVs.

Here is a quick table for single car charging:

Car Voltage|Wattage
:--|:--
400v|80 kW
800v|160 kW
900v|180 kW

Here is a table for two car charging:

Car 1 Volts|Car 2 Volts|Car 1 Watts|Car 2 Watts
:--|:--|:--|:--
400v|400v|40 kW|40 kW
400v|800v|40 kW|80 kW
400v|900v|40 kW|90 kW
800v|800v|80 kW|80 kW
800v|900v|80 kW|90 kW
900v|900v|90 kW|90 kW

So, unless you have a Lucid (afaik the only 900v EV) you can probably ignore those numbers.

SirEDCaLot,"Not all sites/dispensers yet.  

A lot of older dispensers don't have the PLC interface necessary for full NACS / J3400 communication, they only have the older serial interface that Tesla's used since the beginning.  That's a hardware change, specifically a new interface board in the dispenser (and possibly something in the cabinet also but not sure).  The unit should also be capable of understanding Plug&Charge.

I suspect a lot of the NACS delay is Tesla retrofitting these interfaces on old stalls.  It'll certainly be a cheaper/easier/faster retrofit than adding a Magic Dock.

It's also worth noting that currently, as other charge networks deploy NACS/J3400, those new ports will most likely only work with newer Teslas equipped to accept the CCS-NACS adapter as they will only speak PLC and not the old serial protocol.

This will give Ford EV customers unprecedented access to fast-charging
* Mustang Mach-E, F-150 Lightning and E-Transit customers will be able to access the Superchargers via an adapter and software integration along with activation and payment via FordPass or Ford Pro Intelligence
* In 2025, Ford will offer next-generation electric vehicles with the North American Charging Standard (NACS) connector built-in, eliminating the need for an adapter to access Tesla Superchargers

theotherharper,"I honestly love it. It does so well on NEC 110.12 ""Neat and workmanlike"" that an AHJ would have to be a real \*\*\*\* to red-flag it.

perrochon,"The interactive explorer is here: [https://afdc.energy.gov/stations/#/find/nearest?fuel=ELEC](https://afdc.energy.gov/stations/#/find/nearest?fuel=ELEC)

This is a nice tool to have. However, I think not breaking out slow charging DCSL (50kW, 60kW, up to 149kW) creates an overly optimistic and misleading picture.

The experience is very different between a 10 minute charge at a 250kW or 350kW or a 1 hour charge at a 50kW. Driving a ""fuel corridor"" with 3 stops for an hour each is exactly the bad experience that many ICE drivers fear, and different from 3 stops at 10 minutes each.

It should be noted in red bold letters that the ""status"" as presented in this data set is the status for the bad experience, and as such not really documenting how far we have come.

The DOE really should require and provide that information to get a better charging set that can be used by all navigation providers - charging level per post, not just the max number or a range.

It also offers routes that few EVs can drive (any?) without any warning  E.g.

[https://afdc.energy.gov/stations/#/find/route?start=west%20yellowstone&end=fargo&fuel=ELEC&ev\_levels=dc\_fast&ev\_connectors=J1772COMBO](https://afdc.energy.gov/stations/#/find/route?start=west%20yellowstone&end=fargo&fuel=ELEC&ev_levels=dc_fast&ev_connectors=J1772COMBO)

And in Bozeman, you get two options. According to PlugShare one has one 62kW, and the other has 50kW. Both are in the automotive malls outside town, so basically you have one dead hour. This is a horrible experience. We should not count this a ""success""

Looking at this data set opens the question why most manufacturers are moving to NACS. Consumers look at this data and believe they have an ideal charging experience everywhere with CCS. Then they get disappointed.

The White House looks at this data set and probably thinks we are making relevant progress, but we don't. It's polluted with 50kW locations.

The laggards among the OEM probably also look at this data set and think they are in good shape. But they are not.  If one looks at actually *fast* chargers that provide a good experience, the whole relation changes, and it's now NACS by a far margin.","<div class=""md""><p>The interactive explorer is here: <a href=""https://afdc.energy.gov/stations/#/find/nearest?fuel=ELEC"">https://afdc.energy.gov/stations/#/find/nearest?fuel=ELEC</a></p>

AbleDanger12,"Very nice! I have same charger, outside under an awning and did 6AWG THHN in a conduit. Major PITA. Had to use raintight fittings, etc. Ran the EMT to a junction box to a flexible whip over to the charger. Came out looking pretty nice overall.Pulled a permit, just waiting for weather to be a bit warmer before scheduling inspection.

Only thing I am worried about is I'm in a townhouse with 100A service, and the load calc might be pretty tight. Thankfully stove and water heater are gas, and HVAC are mini-splits. Only big electric consumers are the 3 ea forced air wall heaters and the dryer. Due to all that, and the fact my car only has a 3.7kW charger in it, I decided on a 30A circuit, so 24A capacity, but my car won't draw more than 16A anyways, so a little future proofing.

Since mine's in conduit, the inspection department said I can do both the 'cover' and final inspections at same time. For the inspection did you just need to show the panel interior? Power on/off? Did you have to show the connections inside the ChargePoint? I want to be able to make it as easy and painless as possible for the inspector when they come.","<div class=""md""><p>Very nice!

**The ‘worst of all worlds’ for EV charging companies as Tesla swoops in**

EV charging networks ChargePoint and Blink Charging are burning through cash quickly as automakers frustrated with poor charger reliability start to create their own networks.

Electric vehicle charging network companies know that this is crunch time.

Low utilization rates and high operating costs are hamstringing profits. Money is tight. Charging satisfaction is at an all-time low. And after waiting years for networks to get it together, automakers are joining with Tesla Inc. in an unexpected alliance.

**Two of the largest publicly held charging networks in the U.S., ChargePoint and Blink Charging, have less than a year of cash left, according to their most recent quarterly filings.**

They both said their business models, reliant on charger equipment sales more than owning and operating networks themselves, were not as sensitive to cash burn. But company leaders and industry analysts agree that this is a decisive moment for the networks.

""It's kind of a perfect storm"" for charging network companies, said Sam Abuelsamid, an analyst at Guidehouse Insights. ""They're facing new competition, and their customers are not happy, and they need to spend money, but they can't get the money, so it's kind of the worst of all worlds for them.""

Burning up

Some of the largest charging companies, such as Electrify America, are privately held and do not publish information about their financial performance.

But others are running through cash reserves.

ChargePoint's net cash used in operating activities ballooned to about $104 million in its fiscal first quarter from about $71 million during the same period a year earlier.

Meanwhile, its cash at the end of the quarter shrunk to roughly $314 million from about $541 million the year prior, leaving about nine months of cash on hand.

**Operating losses are the ""primary driver"" of increased cash burn, ChargePoint CFO Rex Jackson said in June during the first fiscal quarter conference call with analysts.**

Spokesperson AJ Gosselin said that the company was committed to reducing losses before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization — a common financial adjustment — by two-thirds by the fiscal fourth quarter, which ends Jan 31, and generating earnings by that same measure a year later.

""The cash burn will slow materially,"" he said in an email.

ChargePoint moved to shore up its finances via a credit agreement in July with J.P. Morgan, HSBC, Goldman Sachs and Citi. It also raised $67 million through at-the-market offerings, when companies sell shares into the market at the current market price instead of a fixed price.

Blink Charging also is going through cash fast. It spent $65 million on operating activities during the first half of the year, more than double the roughly $31 million during the same six-month period last year. (The company reported cash flow data for a six-month rather than quarterly period.)

Its cash at the end of the period shrunk to about $75 million from $89 million during the same time last year, leaving it with roughly seven months of cash on hand.

The company also relies more heavily on equipment sales than on owning and operating chargers, though there are costs associated with replacing legacy chargers that have become a ""burden"" because of outdated technology and reliability issues, Blink CEO Brendan Jones told Automotive News.

Jones also acknowledged that the industry ""made mistakes"" early on, installing chargers without paying close attention to their locations and making the wrong investments, the result of a ""technology curve"" that appears to be flattening. Jones previously worked at charging networks Electrify America and EVgo.

""It's a point of reflection to, 'Now let's work on the quality,' "" he said. Analysts ""want to see station economics improved, cost improved and profitability, and we have a path to get there.""

He said Blink is expecting more revenue as EV adoption grows, and the company expects to generate earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization by December 2024. Blink's most recent filing also reflects costs associated with acquisitions and a payout to the former CEO.

One large publicly held charging network, EVgo, has found a safe harbor for now by raising more than $123 million in net proceeds from an equity offering in the second quarter. That company has burned through nearly $23 million in the first half of the year, down from about $38 million for the same six-month period last year. EVgo's cash at the end of the period declined to about $257 million from $345 million the year prior, leaving it with about six years of cash left.

Taking charge

But even the networks that have dodged financial distress are facing a mutiny. Automakers, frustrated with the impact that unreliable and unavailable charging has had on sales and EV perception, are creating their own networks.

""They need to do what they need to do to sell cars,"" said EVgo CEO Cathy Zoi during an August investor conference call outlining the company's quarterly financial performance.

To be sure, legacy charging networks have partnered with automakers for years. ChargePoint has teamed up with Mercedes-Benz, Toyota, Lexus and others. Blink has contracted with automakers such as Mitsubishi, Subaru and General Motors. EVgo has partnered with GM, Nissan, BMW and more.

But the lackluster customer experience is clearly on automakers' minds. J.D. Power's 2023 Electric Vehicle Consideration study found that nearly half of shoppers who would not purchase an EV cited a lack of charging station availability.

Another survey from J.D. Power released in August found that satisfaction with public charging has reached its lowest point on record, and as of the first half of the year, 1 in 5 charging attempts fails.

Poor reliability is one of the reasons why Ford Motor Co. and GM both entered into agreements with Tesla in May and June that will allow the legacy automakers' EVs to use Tesla's Superchargers.

GM said it will build Tesla's North American Charging Standard connectors into its EVs starting in 2025. Ford said drivers will be able to connect to Tesla chargers using adapters next spring and later using Tesla ports built into vehicles.

Until this summer, Tesla rivals pushed a different technology called the Combined Charging System. Rivian, Polestar, Volvo and Mercedes also are committing to North American Charging Standard ports.

Charging companies ""were not able to provide a very reliable network,"" said Akshay Singh, an automotive partner at PwC's Strategy&. ""Charging is a big part of customer experience, and so that's why OEMs have decided to take this into their own hands.""","<div class=""md""><p>Archive</p>

OspreyJimOnReddit,I'd buy the cable. I've been to charging stations where I had to wait for a stall. If I had to wait for two stalls to open up I'd never get a stall until the middle of the night. That's the selfish reason. The other is I'd like to be thought of as a nice guy while I'm charging. Not interested in sitting there using up two stalls while someone waits for me to finish because I made access to one of the stalls impossible.,"<div class=""md""><p>I&#39;d buy the cable.

GrowToShow19,"It definitely looks like a cheaper outlet, but as long as you don’t frequently unplug and replug the charger, and keep an eye on it for any signs of heat damage, you’ll likely be okay. Every now and then after the car has been charging for a little while, feel all around the outlet and plug. Obviously being careful to not touch the live prongs. It should feel warm, but not hot. 

Another option to further increase safety is reducing the charging current if your car or EVSE support it. You likely don’t need to charge at the full 40 amps.

ZanyDroid,"This looks like a fun project and pretty good worksmanship and ingenuity, but looks like a good chunk of time. I assume this is because you didn't have much knowledge on doing electrical work/reconfiguring permanent home wiring?

Looks like you're going to revisit this though based on the other comments. You should be able to piece together fairly detailed help on how to do this to code on here and other forums. It does take a while to pull that together though, depends on how much you value the learning process (I personally enjoy it, so I'm willing to sink in like 50 hours on forums and doing shopping/my own calculations and engineering to save $800. That does significantly undervalue my time a lot if all I cared about was the Benjamins)

If you end up going with a manual switcher with the new setup, make sure to read up and understand whether the one you pick is rated for switching under load.","<div class=""md""><p>This looks like a fun project and pretty good worksmanship and ingenuity, but looks like a good chunk of time.

First rule is always make sure the power is off to whatever you're working on.

Second rule is to use a multimeter or non-contact voltage tester to confirm that the power is off.
