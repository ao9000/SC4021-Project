MrLionOtterBearClown,"I loveeeeeee my Tesla but some of the people on r/Teslamotors are fucking weirdos. It's like an Elon obsession combined with a superiority complex of owning what's usually like a $50k car, stupid that you got banned.

And I totally agree with your post. Holy fuck they were beyond incompetent in my delivery process. Mine isn't as bad as yours but it was still fucking infuriating.

I order it and they tell me it'll probably be a few months. That's fine, whatever, just happy I'll get the car soon. About a week later they call me saying it'll actually be there in two weeks. Okay that's fucking great, but I had a co-signer and the co-signer was going to be out of town. So they very kindly adjusted their travel arrangements to make this happen, with the condition that I am very aggressive in confirming we'll actually get the car then. So I do that, I call them 2 days prior and basically ask them to confirm my car will be there and they say yes. The next day they call me and say it'll actually be another fucking 3-4 weeks due to ""things being crazy"" and an ""error with their logistical systems."" 

Ok so that's fucking great, my co-signer is pissed off and I'm now out of a car for a month because I sold mine earlier that week. They can't give me uber credits or a loaner car because of ""demand."" 

So I wait about 3 weeks and get a call from them saying my Tesla will be there in about 2 days and that I can pick it up at 5:30.  Great. So I get in the car with my co-signer to drive to the dealership, which is about 20 minutes away, at 5:20 (I was running late, sue me). At 5:30 (literally when I'm supposed to be picking up the car) they give me call saying they're sorry but it'll actually be another two weeks because of the fires in California. For reference, I live in Chicago. It takes 31 hours  without stopping to drive from the Tesla factory to my town. So with trucking labor laws, that's clearly a 3 day drive. So I start asking them ""why would you tell me it would be here 2 days ago, when it should've already been on the way here, when it clearly wasn't on the truck?"" ""Why did you not call me earlier? How did you not realize you didn't have the car until the moment I was supposed to take delivery?"" All I get is ""sir, I'm sorry, and I understand your frustration"" fucking over and over again until they eventually offer me a year of free Tesla premium and say they ""can't do any better.""

And the next time I finally got the car, and the salesman had the audacity to ask me to write a Google review and I finally lost it and said ""Yeah I'll write a review about how you rescheduled on me 3 times with 0 heads up and have a lower standard for customer service then the fucking Wendy's across the street, but only if you still want me to write a review"" and he sheepishly said no and handed me the keycards. 

And I realize I sound like a Karen asshole there but come on. I work as a financial advisor. I'm held to a really high standard customer service wise. And obviously, that's a really small part of my job. I have a lot of other work to do on top of customer service, but I maintained a higher standard of customer service when I was a delivery driver for fucking Jimmy Johns..... The infuriating part for me was that customer service is their *entire fucking job*. It's not like most car dealerships, there's 0 negotiation component because you have to buy the car online, and they don't have to prospect customers because their demand is insane. Literally all they do is schedule test drives, coordinate deliveries, and answer questions in the showrooms. I really don't think I'm being unreasonable when I expect them to make some level of effort after I gave their company $60k.","<div class=""md""><p>I loveeeeeee my Tesla but some of the people on <a href=""/r/Teslamotors"">r/Teslamotors</a> are fucking weirdos.

r/teslamotors isn't able to accept any criticism on Teslas. It's really really bad.

I once posted that I didn't like how the Model Y I ordered doesn't come with a parcel shelf because any hatchback, wagon or SUV usually comes with a (retractable) parcel shelf. I got massively downvoted and received angry comments like ""If it bothers you than buy another car"".

People there are really narrow minded and the sub is filled with the worst fanboys. And mind you, I say this as a future Tesla owner (should get it in March). But I think neither the car nor the company are bad because of toxic fanboys. And as I see the mods are even worse...

But in regards of your experience (and I think I came across your post before it was deleted) this is really fucked up in multiple ways. Giving you only 3 days to chose from and then cancelling the day you chose without a backup option is unacceptable. And they should really be able to keep the car a week longer to get it to you; it's not like you asked them to keep it there for months

How did it play out now? Did you cancel? Did you finally get your car? **Any updates?**

[deleted],"2 years, 52k miles, 8 appointments, still not right from delivery. Amazing vehicle. Terrible build quality and service. To be fair, that’s what I would expect from a company that is still ramping up output to reach demand.

***

EDIT: Not on mobile anymore, so here's more details.

* Car is noisy AF. I've since driven two 2018 Model 3s (mine is a 2019) as loaners during recent service-center trips. They were MUCH quieter than mine. I got a dud.
* The car is poorly assembled. To be clear, this isn't an ""all Model 3s are poorly assembled"" complaint. MINE is. The dash spilt horizontally under the deco, causing a loud rattle. It's been fixed. The B-pillar keeps falling off. It's been ""fixed"" at nearly every appointment I've been at so far. Most of them have just snapped it back on, but the last appointment, the employee confirmed that several clips were broken, so it was impossible to fix permanently. It was replaced with a new part.
* The touchscreen is janky. Again, not all Models 3s, just mine. I need to reboot every 3rd or 4th drive. Yesterday, it took 4 consecutive reboots before my GPS location and direction would be correct. This happens occasionally, but this is the first time it didn't correct after one reboot. It makes the car appear to be ""flying"" over the map as a I drive, as the car's arrow is near but not where I'm actually located, and it moves in a random direction, but not the direction I'm pointed in. I suspect the car's compass is borked, but until I can get it happening every drive, Tesla can't fix it. Tesla's service centers have an unofficial requirement that you diagnose and reproduce all problems for them.
* Acceleration feels overly stiff. Thought it was normal until I drove those other two 3s (all three are LR AWD and they were NOT locked in chill mode as expected). Acceleration was smoother, more predictable, and more fun. There was an OBVIOUS difference that both my wife and I noticed. Was told it was ""within spec"" (seriously, fuck that phrase) by their employee.

Those are the ongoing issues. They've fixed numerous issues during those 8 appointments over 2 years. We have since purchased a Model Y for my wife, and it's fucking flawless. My plan right now is to order a new Model 3 LR AWD (trade-in value is obscene), and trade it in as ""within spec,"" and let them deal with it. I should have lemon lawed it when I could.

***

Just to be clear, my experience is NOT typical, and despite it being what it was, my wife and I STILL bought a second Tesla, and are looking to trade mine in for another. I think that given the nature of the company (ramping up production due to supply/demand imbalance, lack of global competition) buyers should go in expecting that quality and service will be Tesla's weak points.","<div class=""md""><p>2 years, 52k miles, 8 appointments, still not right from delivery.

zipzoomramblafloon,"I'm in this boat too kinda.
my credit app was in limbo for a week, The website told me to call the toll free number to speak with someone. The toll free number told me to use the online chat for my problem. The online chat had no section for discussing credit apps that would let me talk to a person. I had to pick a different option on the online chat to get a live person, who transferred me elsewhere to someone who said they'd send a email about this to the finance team.

I have a warning about possible fraud on my account, There was no call from tesla to verify it was really me doing the app.

They finally approved my request, and asked for some documents, which I provided via the website. Then after about an hour they declined my credit app. I emailed asking wtf after which they decided my documents were good enough and then approved my app again.

3 business days later and I'm still waiting for them to ????? so my reservation turns into an order.

I think my biggest laugh dealing with tesla so far was the online chat rep who said ""thanks for accelerating our transition to clean energy"" and I was like ""You could do this much quicker by not selling emissions credits to traditional ICE car makers, but then you would lose 70% of your income""

I also love how tesla doesn't seem to include the 240v charger with the vehicle so I gotta buy that as charging @ 120 is a joke. 

Tesla has by far been the most annoying company to buy a car from, and taken the longest just for financing approval. I can't wait until I get to the part where I have to wait for them to build the damn thing.

Good luck OP.","<div class=""md""><p>I&#39;m in this boat too kinda.

Whoever runs their automatic CRM messages needs to improve the language sent out and black out holidays.</p>

[deleted],"I own a Tesla and I love the car, but your experience is an odd one and definitely not something I would enjoy. I of course got lucky, I was a nuisance to them and asked for a more available car than to wait for production, and that happened during my vacation. 

However, it is a problem that they cannot hold a car for a few more days and these mistakes are becoming more and more common from what I've been reading. I don't get why people have to be such assholes, it's not like Elon made you get rid of the car as quickly as possible. Though it does sound like the end of the month sale and they are trying to get the max number possible done in a month. Stupid, really.

As for the /r/teslamotors, they are clearly in the wrong. Nothing in their rule 2 says your post is not high quality or that you cannot post personal experiences.

>""All posts should be about Tesla Inc. and general questions belong in the stickied support thread or r/TeslaLounge.""

That sentence doesn't even make sense. Are posts about Tesla Inc. okay? Are general questions okay? What exactly should be posted in /r/TeslaLounge ? 

High quality post isn't even defined. It appears that their mods are more in a cult than most subscribers and probably think North Korea is the best country in the world. Mods are basically like Kim.

You can return your car within 1000 miles, I believe that's still a thing. Though I do think Tesla has the best EVs. We should definitely be voting with our wallets if companies are not willing to listen and solve issues.","<div class=""md""><p>I own a Tesla and I love the car, but your experience is an odd one and definitely not something I would enjoy.

Hour-Acceptable,"Tesla customer service is awful and i sold my model Y after 6 months because of it.

First they called me at the end of Q2 and said ""we hAve a model Y here but a different interior, do you want it""

So of course i said yes. After 10 days they decreased the price of the model Y by 3k!!! I asked if they would compensate me for depreciating a brand new vehicle like that mid year and they could care less, they just wanted that car off the lot prior to their quarter ending. Loved having that car depreciate about 5-6k in 10 days...

A few weeks later i also noticed that my bumper was literally yellow compared to the rest of the panels ""white"". Took it in and they treated me like an idiot. It wasnt until i argued and let them know that I used to call on their fremont factory as a paint rep when they would have these kinds of issues.

FlugMe,"I'll start off by saying I'm not a fan of Elon's personality, I think his companies do great things, but wish he'd stfu sometimes. But I only have 1 real question, do you REALLY know the people involved with building a Polestar? How can you verify that giving them money would be any different if not worse? Just because they aren't famous on twitter, how can you verify the CEO, major investors, even people on the production line aren't complete asshats, or worse. It's an honest question that I think a lot of people don't approach objectively. 

Buying a VW? Did we all forget about the Nazi's or Diesel Gate? I owned a 2014 Leaf, you know, the car built by a companies who's CEO at the time is now a convicted felon. What about Volvo? Good luck finding information on a Chinese billionare (Geely). One way or another, your money is going to a psychotic billionaire, just one of them makes an idiot of themselves on twitter.

Personally I have a high appreciation for the engineering that goes into the Tesla, and having gone through 3 EVs now (and driving a polestar), I can tell you that they get more things right than the competition. Having said that, I don't think a Polestar 2 is a bad choice, it's a very nice car.","<div class=""md""><p>I&#39;ll start off by saying I&#39;m not a fan of Elon&#39;s personality, I think his companies do great things, but wish he&#39;d stfu sometimes.

[deleted],"Said like a person who only found out where Ukraine was on a map via CNN after February 24th. Polestar is owned by Geely which is part owned by China's CCP and Musk supplies Ukraine with its internet infrastructure at the moment, for the record. Since no one else here will say it, I will. Wars only ever end in only two ways, a mountain of bodies or the negotiation table. Period. Ukraine has absolutely no chance of winning if the gloves come off, but they do have a chance of provoking a tactical nuclear strike on Kyiv. NATO must continue to refuse them an Article 5 guarantee because that would all but guarantee global nuclear war on paper. That's not something I want to even have nightmares about, but it's dumbass posts like this that make me worried. Do you have any idea how quickly the United States would tactically nuke Mexico City if the Chinese planted missile systems there? Ukraine was the brightest of bright red lines for Russia and even Obama said so in 2015. Going further, George Kennan said so in 1998 in an interview with Thomas Friedman for the NY Times. The situation is worse than anything you think. The US military industrial complex is pouring $40 billion into a proxy war that uses Ukraine's entire state to bleed/test Russia's military capabilities. Worse yet is your ignorance of America's role in provoking the conflict since 2013. Ukraine is getting used by the military you directly fund via NATO and you're here moralizing about imperialism while buying a Chinese made vehicle. It's truly breathtaking. Detente immediately. Negotiating table immediately. Anything else is simply amoral.

Wars only ever end in only two ways, a mountain of bodies or the negotiation table. Period. Ukraine has absolutely no chance of winning if the gloves come off, but they do have a chance of provoking a tactical nuclear strike on Kyiv. NATO must continue to refuse them an Article 5 guarantee because that would all but guarantee global nuclear war on paper. That&#39;s not something I want to even have nightmares about, but it&#39;s dumbass posts like this that make me worried. Do you have any idea how quickly the United States would tactically nuke Mexico City if the Chinese planted missile systems there? Ukraine was the brightest of bright red lines for Russia and even Obama said so in 2015. Going further, George Kennan said so in 1998 in an interview with Thomas Friedman for the NY Times. The situation is worse than anything you think. The US military industrial complex is pouring $40 billion into a proxy war that uses Ukraine&#39;s entire state to bleed/test Russia&#39;s military capabilities. Worse yet is your ignorance of America&#39;s role in provoking the conflict since 2013. Ukraine is getting used by the military you directly fund via NATO and you&#39;re here moralizing about imperialism while buying a Chinese made vehicle. It&#39;s truly breathtaking. Detente immediately. Negotiating table immediately. Anything else is simply amoral. I haven&#39;t even begun to mention what the energy crisis will do to Europe during this winter.</p>

He is restructuring the company to match the engineering leadership model of tesla and spacex.  The people who praise those companies and hate having twitter set up the same way have no credibility.

Facebook just laid off 11k people to pad their Q report because less profits, not actual losses, somehow required a mass layoff.  Go be outraged about something like that instead of a company that was losing money and is being restructured with a model that is well tested to be very very good for a company and the engineers who work there.

AccomplishedCheck895,"1) legacy auto will never ‘catch up’ to Tesla: Tesla agile process implements multiple changes to production Per Day… legacy auto makes a few changes. Over the years of a models lifetime… today’s (Texas) model Y is a completely different car beneath the skin than the first ones built…
2) some legacy auto aren’t even at the starting line: they aren’t building EV’S from the ground up/completely new design. Some Legacy auto have EV’S with Transmission Tunnels…. 
3) the US legacy auto are not planning for competitive growth: ex., Ford chose to use Mach-e Lithium Ternary batteries when Tesla and Chinese auto, the REAL Tesla competition, chose to go LFP… I.e., Ford chose the more expensive, less mass-producible battery tech which means more expensive… how are you going to drive cost down (COMPETE) when you’ve locked in to the most expensive option for the highest cost component of the car??? And that’s JUST Ford’s example.
4) Ford, GM, Are starting from a place of high debt, how are they going to finance the ground-up, clean slate mass production of EV’S needed to actually compete with Tesla? Are they going to invest in vertically integrating like Tesla and the Chinese (BYD), or are they going to stay with the legacy ‘assemble parts from supplier Bosch’, approach? I.e., being an assembler of parts designed and built by somebody else? They can do that but their product won’t be engineered as well as Tesla’s…

The result of everyone waiting is that they waited Too Long to invest in the New Era. Toyota is ‘Nokia” to Tesla’s “Apple”. They are ‘blockbuster’ to Tesla’s “Netflix”.

[deleted],"**Reasons to stick with the Cybertruck:**

1. Tesla supercharger network.
2. Design (may be a con in your book)
3. Autopilot and FSD (full self driving).
4. Range. Tesla's battery tech is ahead of other EV makers.

**Reasons to choose Rivian or someone else:**

1. The prices advertised for the Cybertruck in 2019 are not going to be anywhere near the real prices when it releases.
2. The cost of FSD keeps going up every few months even though the product is still in beta. I paid $6000 for it back in 2019, am a beta tester and love the tech, but it is $15000 today and definitely not worth that price. Musk has hinted  the price will continue going up as the product nears completion and at that point, most of use wont be able to afford it, making a Tesla not that different from the non self driving competition.

hoppeeness,"This is a great post.   

It is a good thought exercise.   If electric cars came first there would be so much resistance to gas.  Noise, fumes, infrastructure, cost, having to go somewhere to fuel, slow.

Only reason there is resistance to EVs is because people don’t like the unknown and are comfortable with what they are used to.  

“Can you make my gasoline horseless carriage sound more like a horse?   There is something visceral and engaging about the noise horses make.  Like they have a soul.”

Just great post.   If I had awards to give you would get one.

Edit:  just so people stop posting.  Yes electric and gas vehicles came out almost the same time originally but barely anyone had electricity at the time and it was expensive.

tristancliffe,"1.	No, you have to use ultra-super-amazing-fast chargers at ""petrol stations"". These can add hundreds of miles of range in less than 5 minutes. Very unlikely to have a range of less than 350 miles, and some can do over a thousand miles on one charge whilst still not weighing so much that road surfaces can't cope. 
2.	The box with gears barely needs touching unless you buy a very high mileage vehicle. Engines need less than £100 spending annually, and it can easily be done by all but the most hamfisted home mechanic. Engine and boxes of gears never go wrong really (in the grand scheme of things) - it's always suspension, brakes, electrics or body-rot. 
3.	Yes. The right pedal will provide acceleration and retardation. Using the box of gears you could slow down quite quickly without using the brakes. Brakes remain standard for emergency use or if you haven't planned ahead sufficiently. 
4.	No in most cars (some mild hybrids and beyond do), but fuel supply is cut off on a trailing throttle so you aren't using fuel either. 
5.	No that isn't normal. Throttle response should be imperceptible, even with a turbocharger and automatic gearbox. There is some delay with most automatic boxes of gears on initial getaway (to do with torque converters), but it's minor and after 30 minutes you won't notice it. 
6.	Cost per mile of fuel is mostly tax. Currently electricity isn't taxed for motoring (but it will be, so expect cost per mile to increase). Usually offset by cheaper initial purchase price. 
7.	Not really. Fuel vapour is flammable, but in a sealed tank there is no risk of fire. Not likely to spontaneously combust like the old fashioned batteries currently economically viable. 
8.	Build in to all cars. There are shut off valves, tanks are designed to resist splitting, and if fuel does leak it isn't very likely to catch fire. Can also be put out quickly and relatively easily - won't burn for 5 days. 
9.	The solution is to stop using energy. Whether it's solar, mining lithium or other nasty chemicals, or sucking up crude, there will be wars, embargos, lives lost, environmental impact and more. An alternative solution would be to ban all cars unless they have (or have booked to take) more than 4 (or 10!) people on board to limit waste. 
10. Yes, lots of fuel powered cars are banned in cities or will be. People (voters and tax payers) generally prefer if the emissions are made somewhere else (equally damaging but ""someone else's problem"") so they feel smug and not have to smell or think about the harm they're causing.

FlamingoImpressive92,"like haha funny, but there's a reason even in Europe 90% of cars sold still have an engine in them. The reality of ICE is that a Dacia Sandero can go 100 miles further than a long range Model S, charge up 20x faster than a Porsche Taycan all while costing 1/4 the cost of the cheapest VW ID3. Theres a reason the Golf is still the best selling model.

I'm a huge fan of EV's but this kind of ""wHy WOulD anYonE EVeR Buy a diEsle cAr EV'S arE beTtEr IN evEry SINGLe WAY"" thinking just gets EV proponents labelled as delusional and elitist. If you actually want to convince people (instead of just calling them stupid while high fiving other EV owners) ***show*** them how EV's are better;

* show performance enthusiasts the Taycan/Plaids launches and the handling of the prosche and model 3
* for tight pocketed people show them how cheap a Zoe is per mile and how reliable and long lasting an EV can be

Its a really well-written shitpost, but a lot of this thinking [is growing](https://youtu.be/YnTlQW57lUg?t=636) and I'm worried its going to genuinely have a negative effect on EV uptake. Its [happened before](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmG64mVQV3g) and I've been surprised anecdotally by how many people are put off buying an EV by this kind of attitude amongst owners.","<div class=""md""><p>like haha funny, but there&#39;s a reason even in Europe 90% of cars sold still have an engine in them. The reality of ICE is that a Dacia Sandero can go 100 miles further than a long range Model S, charge up 20x faster than a Porsche Taycan all while costing 1/4 the cost of the cheapest VW ID3. Theres a reason the Golf is still the best selling model.</p>

<p>I&#39;m a huge fan of EV&#39;s but this kind of &quot;wHy WOulD anYonE EVeR Buy a diEsle cAr EV&#39;S arE beTtEr IN evEry SINGLe WAY&quot; thinking just gets EV proponents labelled as delusional and elitist. If you actually want to convince people (instead of just calling them stupid while high fiving other EV owners) <strong><em>show</em></strong> them how EV&#39;s are better;</p>

<ul>
<li>show performance enthusiasts the Taycan/Plaids launches and the handling of the prosche and model 3</li>
<li>for tight pocketed people show them how cheap a Zoe is per mile and how reliable and long lasting an EV can be</li>

joekaistoe,"1. You may need to purchase additional accessories in order to refuel at home (i.e. A still)
2. The petrol engine requires fairly frequent servicing relative to an electric vehicle.  Most other components will require similar servicing intervals to your previous vehicle, although brakes may need a somewhat more frequent interval.  Most gearboxes change gears by themselves.  If changing gears is a concern, look for an ""Automatic"" transmission.
3. Somewhat, but not well enough to rely on.
4. If you drive a petrol car like the first one I owned, the gas gauge clearly shows you gain fuel when braking and turning left, but lose fuel when accelerating or turning right.
5. You may have been driving a old, or lower quality model.  High end modern cars have a nearly imperceptible delay when pressing the accelerator.
6. The higher price for petrol is the cost of the lower upfront cost.  It's expensive to be poor.
7. Petrol is flammable, but don't worry! As long as it's safely contained in the gas tank of the car, the chance of it igniting is extremely low.  If it does start on fire, it's relatively easy to put out with a simple fire extinguisher.  The lubricating oil in the engine is much more likely to ignite than the petrol, since it's kept much closer to very hot components.
8. Sadly, whenever you store a bunch of energy in one place, there's always a chance of fire.  Don't believe the movies, the gasoline doesn't explode at the slightest jostling! There are automatic systems, but they're not cost effective for consumer vehicles at this time.
9. Yes, they have caused these issues. Yes there is a solution, fewer vehicles, more public transportation and less consumption.
10. It is true! Unfortunately, banning petrol vehicles is only a half measure in reducing the environmental damage that all vehicles do.

I think you have all of the points correct except for #6. As more people (unlike you) switch from petrol to electric, it will cause the price of gasoline to go down. Lowering demand by 5% actually drops the price of oil by 50% (see 1980s, 2009, 2020).

MonteLSV6,"1) No they can’t refill at home, gas is dangerous and highly flammable. So there’s probably won’t be an I’m home refuel station - duh lol

2) Usually the main parts that need serviced is engine (oil change every 5k miles imo at least), transmission fluid service every 30k miles (depending on manual), and cleaning the air filter at every oil change, or at least looking at it. Brake pads should last 50-60k miles or more. Tires are anywhere from 30-50k miles

3) No you can’t, but you can do what’s called engine breaking.

4) No, but you use less of it if coasting

5) Yes that is normal. Manufacturers make the pedal mushy to appease the boring drivers or today so everything is smooth and peaceful. Try putting it in Sport mode next time, everything has a Sport mode.

6) Idk what I pay, probably twice that

7) Yes it is. No, it’s self contained in a pretty secure and isolated tank so no need to empty it out. Unless you have a Racecar and stole race fuel in VP Racing jugs.

8) Usually it doesn’t, there’s rare cases but gas catching fire or exploding upon impact is a thing of the past. Otherwise it’s called a fire extinguisher and they can be found for about $20.

9) Yeah you betcha! Similar to lithium mining, but after 5 ish years EV’s only start to benefit instead of ICE. At least that’s how it is in the US depending on how your state gets it’s Power from.

10) I have heard of them being banned from new ICE vehicles being sold, but not entering cities. Yes, although emissions are hell of a lot better than they used to be and they’re getting better every year.

<p>9) Yeah you betcha! Similar to lithium mining, but after 5 ish years EV’s only start to benefit instead of ICE. At least that’s how it is in the US depending on how your state gets it’s Power from.</p>

<p>10) I have heard of them being banned from new ICE vehicles being sold, but not entering cities. Yes, although emissions are hell of a lot better than they used to be and they’re getting better every year. </p>

<p>Now excuse me while I go to the gas station hearing the roar of the engine and turbochargers to pay $60 to fill up on premium gas instead of driving in silence and a boring commute to work. :slightly_smiling_face:</p>

sernamenotdefined,"Sadly #1 is why I'll be going back to to ICE for real. 

  
I bought an EV with the promise from the municipality that I could get a charger in the street by my house (don't have a private driveway to charge). After I had signed a 5 year lease on a BEV based on that they started stalling.

After 3 years I finally got a definitive answer: The grid can't handle more chargers. They won't be updating that anytime soon, so in the foreseeable future I can't charge at home.  


This means every movement I do is now extended with a stay at a 'fast' charger costing me a lot of time every week. Until they upgrade the grid I will be going back to a BEV I can fill up 'on the road' in 5 minutes instead of 45 minutes.

Fireflyfanatic1,"1. I heard that you forget to plug your car in one night and drive off you could be stranded in the middle of winter without anyway to refuel while stranded?

2.  When the one battery part your car may need goes out you may need to spend as much on the batteries as you did the Car and it cannot be fixed without taking it into a shop?

3.  Yes every time I let off the gas I slow down.

4.   Yes you gain extra miles from letting off the gas when going down hill and get hella good range.

5.  Was the car you drove for acceleration in the same price range as an EV.   I don’t think so.

6.  Not sure where you are located but dam you pay a lot for Petrol.  To make up EV cost will take five years and right about time time I may need new EV batteries. 

7. Is it true people are told it’s safer to Charge your EV’s away from you house to reduce fire damage?

8.  Is it true EV fires are extremely hard to contain once started.
 
9. I understand the main ingredients in EV’s require extensive mining of rare earth elements. Some even located in countries use if child labor for Cobalt?","<div class=""md""><ol>

theonetrueelhigh,"1. Correct.  Unless you have a CNG car in which case you could hook up to city gas but that takes special connections, permits etc.  If you have an enormous and comprehensive distillation system in your home you can brew your own alcohol, but that takes space and of course you have to have an alcohol-capable car.  Most won't run on straight alcohol.  Otherwise you will have to avail yourself of privately operated for-profit fueling stations every few hundred miles - not a few times per year but more like a few times per month depending on how often you drive.
2. Everything under the hood.  A convenient schedule is provided in the owner's manual, which most people never read.   The engine will tell you when to change gears: listen for the engine to sound like it is about to fly apart, and shift before it does.
3. Yes, but only if you are on a very steep hill.
4. Yes, but only by crashing into a fuel station.
5. You may have misinterpreted.  It actually began accelerating instantly, but in a much more relaxed fashion than you may have become accustomed to.  Don't feel bad, others in your situation often make the same mistake.
6. Let me refer you to Economics 101 and the perverse relationship between Supply and Demand.  If gas is cheap now, it's because fewer people are using it.
7. Yes.  I recommend somewhere indoors where it won't get contaminated by water; petrol engines, though they are full of cooling water, have to have no water in their fuel.  In the basement should be fine.
8. No.  Be careful.
9. Correct, true, and no.  Rather, not while still using petrol.  The best solution is to use less or no petrol at all.  Electricity, especially electricity generated by renewable sources such as wind and solar, is far more democratic and fairly distributed than gasoline and other fossil-derived energies.

justabadmind,"1. While it is correct that a petrol powered car cannot refuel while you sleep, it's completely possible to refuel at home. Just get a pump installed near where you park your car outside, similar to an electric vehicle. Refueling time is about 5 minutes and you need to refuel somewhere between weekly and monthly. Sometimes less frequently, all depending on what vehicle you get and for what. 

2. It's the same as an electric car, there's a fair few parts that need service. A petrol car has more liquids, but you still will be expected to read the owners manual to do required maintenance. Some of the numbers you can stretch, but if you care about the car, keep it by the book. 

3. As far as one wheel driving goes, that's an electric thing. Some hybrids will have it, but don't count on it. Electric is very different from combustion powered. There's nothing keeping a petrol car from one wheel driving, but it's just not normal for petrol vehicles yet. 

4. As far as getting fuel back goes, that's another electric only thing. Hybrids might have it but not combustion vehicles. Combustion is a one way process. 

5. A delay between pressing the pedal and power? Absolutely normal! Some combustion cars minimize it substantially, but it's definitely still there. It's a big drawback to combustion vehicles. 

6. I don't see a question there, but unfortunately the price of petrol has so much tax on it there's almost no chance of decrease. 

7. Yes, petrol is technically flammable. But I wouldn't call it flammable a bad thing. It doesn't spontaneously combust when exposed to air like batteries might. It takes a lot of air plus a spark to ignite it, plus it doesn't burn long. No need to remove it for storage. 

8. An automatic system to prevent the gasoline from exploding in a fire is designed into all gas tanks sold in the us and eu. No additional cost. 

9. Extracting oil has plenty of drawbacks as you seem to have learned. The solution most of us are leaning towards is burning something else. Food oil is an option, as is methane and hydrogen. This is a far away solution though. 

10. That's probably true, a lot of cities have substantial problems that are leading them to ban petrol vehicles. As far as petrol cars harming the environment, that's kinda complicated. A leaky petrol car can harm the environment due to having more fluids then an electric car, but petrol cars are easier on tires and roads too so it's hard to say which is truly better. Combustion has smog as a byproduct, just like electric vehicles have emf as a byproduct. Personally I think emf is a less concerning byproduct than smog, but it does create problems. The smog is being processed to reduce the quantity of it, but it can't be eliminated entirely.","<div class=""md""><ol>

Supersizing the IRS to Increase Audits – $124 Billion

The bill would spend $80 billion to supersize IRS with 87,000 new agents and auditors and ramp up audits on working households and small businesses. The IRS would perform an additional 1.2 million annual audits under the plan. Democrats claim the increased spending on enforcement would net $124 billion.

The bill spends 14 times as much money for “enforcement” — such as small business audits — than for “taxpayer services” — such as answering the phone. IRS employees only answer the phone “19 or 20 percent” of the time.

Jealous-Nectarine-74,"Here in Ontario I usually see that equipment associated with Scotiabank. They were an early player in rolling out charging in a few of their locations. 

I consider them reliable, in that I've never pulled up to one and found it broken. Of course I would always be checking PlugShare before using one of these, so take that with a grain of salt.

However, Scotia used a wide variety of power levels. I often find them to be 30kw, 50kw at best.

Finally, Scotia's pricing wasn't great, a big connection fee if I recall, and with a few instances of needing to restart a stalled session, we ended up paying it over and over.

I do get what you mean! It seems that tap and pay combined with an automatic card reader like a gas station really could have worked better than apps.

Electric motors are clearly better on their own. Heck, many of the first cars were electric simply because it’s technologically much simpler.

opamine100,"Just read through every comment here and I’ll add my congratulations! I bought a 2020 Bolt on my birthday (60 years old :beaming_face_with_smiling_eyes:) and it was the best thing I ever had purchased. First brand new car we ever could pay cash for. We had solar panels on our home already so filling up with sunshine was an added benefit. It was the first time in 40 years of our marriage that my wife ever said she loved a vehicle. She really is not a car type of person so when she said that I knew we made the right choice together. She loves all the safety features and really likes the blue glowing light across the dashboard. We just finished up a 3,700 mile trip. Phoenix to San Diego and up the pacific coast to the Canada border where we picked up our son who had just completed his 2,653 mile walk from Mexico to Canada on the Pacific Crest Trail. It was the longest vehicle trip we had ever taken in 40 years of marriage. We also agreed that the slower charging  didn’t bother us as we enjoyed being able to stretch and get a bit to eat every 2ish hours. We plan to drive from Phoenix all the way to Toronto Canada to visit our daughter this fall which will be 4,620 miles round trip according to the ABRP app. Needless to say we have fallen in love with our Bolt and still are waiting on the new battery pack. Keep on traveling and enjoying your journey! 
PS. We traded in our 2013 Volt on this Bolt as we made the switch from gas to hybrid to fully electric.","<div class=""md""><p>Just read through every comment here and I’ll add my congratulations!

Thomqa,"Actually, not many people realize that the difference in power consumption between flooring it and accelerating slowly may very well be neglectable. Is essence, when accelerating slowly you needless kW, but you have to maintain that acceleration for longer, resulting in kWh as high as flooring it. When flooring it you pull much more kW from the battery, but you reach your cruising speed quicker. Cruising speed has a relatively low power draw (kW).

We must note that your average speed is higher when accelerating quicker. Due to air resistance, you will consume more energy. But this difference is tiny compared to the rest of your trip. The only way to have a significantly lower energy consumption is by simply maintaining a lower cruising speed.

This is different to ICE, because they need to reach higher revs to accelerate quicker. This consumes more fuel. In most EVs, each speed has always the same rev.

StLandrew,"My ID.3 under reasonably hard acceleration sounds like a jet airliner whistle, but without all that low rumbling combustion noise. Just today I left work, a Friday and midday - it's a nice little regular long weekend thing. Anyway, what did I find at the roundabout but a recent VW Golf GTi hard behind me as I exited. I gently accelerated away and it was still hugging my rear bumper. A straight half-mile beckoned until my turn off. I immediately hit the throttle to half-way and the jet could be heard very softly. In a heartbeat the GTi was a diminishing shape in the rear view mirror. These tuned ICEVs might have performance, but it isn't instant like in a BEV. I'm quite used to it now, but every once in a while I realise that the big, almost effortless, push in the back that I get under hard acceleration is something that ICEVs barely ever experience. Even though it cost me an extra kWh or two. And I realise that the slowest Model 3 would be a second in front of me. BEVs are just so damned quick.","<div class=""md""><p>My ID.3 under reasonably hard acceleration sounds like a jet airliner whistle, but without all that low rumbling combustion noise.

[deleted],"I'm a tesla owner and work in the utility industry. One of the most common anti-EV ~~circlejerks~~ talking points I've heard relates to what will happen to the grid when everyone drives electric. And there's some truth that EVs and home charging will have a significant effect on the power supply and grid.    

An average non-EV home with mostly electric appliances has a baseline power draw of about 1-2 kw. So in a month you expect to use about 1000 kwh. An EV charging overnight will probably require between 1 and 5 kw of power, which is equivalent to running an electric stove or air conditioner. Most houses are designed to accomodate loads for stoves, air conditioners, and dryers with the neighborhood distribution network sized for x houses each with these 3 appliances. Some oversizing is built in, which is why 1 tesla on your block doesn't immediately cause volt sag or brownouts. But if even 50% of houses add an EV that regularly is charged, then the utility will likely need to upgrade transformers and prepare for a different load distribution in the area. This is a change, but should not be a problem for utilities that are pragmatic and adaptable. My utility is very aware of EV adoption and incentivizes it; my parents' rural co-op is not. (Aside, the leadership at this utility recently blamed residential solar for their summertime brownouts. My dad, the first solar customer on their grid, was less than happy). As more EVs connect to the grid, we will likely see a shift from the bell curve peak load to a more consistent load with higher usage overnight. Maybe a long-tail bell curve is a good estimate.       

As EV adoption increases and solar becomes cheaper, it's an easy opportunity to combine the two. DER solar has shown a lot of promise for peak load shaving, and I can see a world where many EV customers add panels to decrease their grid burden, especially in areas where infrastructure upgrades are more challenging. And lost in these conversations is the amount of electricity needed to refine gasoline. As our gas consumption decreases, I expect some of that power to be available to power EVs. We'll see. The grid challenge is there, but it's definitely not insurmountable.    

It's a significant frustration to me that my parents have solar, geothermal, are generally environmentally conscious, yet believe these baloney things about EVs. I try not to get too worked up about it, but it's still sad. The best and most attainable way to move towards sustainable transportation is right here, yet they refuse to even consider it.","<div class=""md""><p>I&#39;m a tesla owner and work in the utility industry.

In essence they’re partnering with chemical companies or oil companies to off take the brine water as a by product.  Then they can inject an absorbent into the brine water and filter it.  Then extract lithium carbonate from the solution. Release clean water back into the ground.  

This has been proven to work on small scale, it’s in the works to be proven on a commercial scale. If so, the dirty mining aspect of lithium argument is gone.  We will probably know in the next 6 months.

cowboyjosh2010,"I expected this to be a puff piece of generalizations that we could all mindlessly circlejerk to, but the author has done some significant homework here to give his position genuine teeth.  Thanks for sharing it!  You're preaching to the choir in this subreddit, but things like the notion that the excess CO2 emissions that go into the average EV's drivetrain are balanced out by the gasoline you don't burn during about 2 years of driving?  That's a pretty eye popping stat.  Same with how it ""only"" takes the energy/CO2 found in about 77 gallons of gasoline to make an average EV battery--another big one.  I would go through 77 gallons of gas in about 7 weeks the way I was driving my Cruze before I got my EV6 (20,000 miles a year, divided by 52 weeks in a year, divided by 33 MPG = 11.6 gal/week).  Yet another really powerful statement is how even the best gasoline car only puts about 25% of its gasoline energy toward motion, while a typical EV puts around 90% of it toward the same.  If you were heating your home, and had to pick a fuel source, would you pick the one where you have to dump 75% of what you buy onto the ground?  Or the one where you have to dump 10% of what you buy onto the ground?  That's an easy call by me.

Good article.  Anyone who tries to live with an EV will usually find that they can't imagine going back to gas anytime soon.  But that's a qualitative gut feeling that is hard to persuade people with.  The way my brain works, quantitative data--especially data that is SO slanted toward one argument the way this data turns out to be--is more impactful.

Roguewave1,"The myriad of moving parts all noisily beating and wearing themselves to pieces clattering and vibrating while searching for the correct gear or spoiling up the turbo in the short power band of an ICE engine pails next to the elegance of the instant and broad torque of an EV power train unless you are fond of noise, vibration, hesitation, shifting, braking and paying at the pump. ~2000 moving (and degrading) parts in the power train of an ICE engine versus 20 in an electric power train. No fluids or belts to get low or refresh except windshield wiper juice.

I cringe every time these days when I am forced for some odd reason to resorting to one of my old legacy ICE vehicles instead of my much preferred Tesla M3lr, but do not get me wrong, I am well aware that the privilege of driving an EV is something the vast majority of people cannot enjoy because of the technology required to produce them with grotesque open mining for the raw materials, often with slave and child labor. It is anything but sustainable without even getting into power generation/transmission requirements, at least until Graphene batteries become viable.

Interesting facts re common lithium battery packs of an EV —

""A typical EV battery weighs one thousand pounds.  It contains twenty-five pounds of lithium, sixty pounds of nickel, 44 pounds of manganese, 30 pounds cobalt, 200 pounds of copper, and 400 pounds of aluminium, steel, and plastic. Inside are over 6,000 individual lithium-ion cells.

""It should concern you that all those toxic components come from mining. For instance, to manufacture each EV auto battery, you must process 25,000 pounds of brine for the lithium, 30,000 pounds of ore for the cobalt, 5,000 pounds of ore for the nickel, and 25,000 pounds of ore for copper. All told, you dig up 500,000 pounds of the earth’s crust for just one battery... Both human rights abuses and environmental degradation are directly connected to the mining for the exotic minerals and metals that are required to manufacture wind turbines, solar panels, and EV batteries.""

I drive a Tesla M3lr every day and consider it, as I said, a privilege to do so because EVs are not a sustainable possibility for the masses, the reasons for such skepticism illustrated above, yet my car is orders of magnitude more drivable and fun than all my previous rides — very, very quick and deadly silent at the same time. The harvesting of raw minerals for batteries, even before addressing problems in adding power generation and transmission of it, is a rapacious endeavor at moving half a million pounds of the Earth’s crust for each average present technology battery.","<div class=""md""><p>The myriad of moving parts all noisily beating and wearing themselves to pieces clattering and vibrating while searching for the correct gear or spoiling up the turbo in the short power band of an ICE engine pails next to the elegance of the instant and broad torque of an EV power train unless you are fond of noise, vibration, hesitation, shifting, braking and paying at the pump. ~2000 moving (and degrading) parts in the power train of an ICE engine versus 20 in an electric power train.

The necessity for mining has increased with demand, which mining companies are struggling to fulfill. Mining companies in the US are drastically behind other countries when it comes to facilities, trained employees, speed of permit regulations, etc. So we are looking to China to fulfill that in the interim. This causes a host of other problems in the process. in short Pres. Biden’s goal of all new cars being EV by 2035, cannot be fulfilled without some extreme changes. For instance, there is a big push to begin collecting copper, nickel, manganese and cobalt off the ocean floor. Which could have massive impacts on the environment. Another issue we face is the problems of the dead batteries. It's often cheaper for batterymakers to buy freshly mined metals than to use recycled materials. On top of that, in order to recycle the materials it often takes harmful chemicals that the EPA says, poses an ""unreasonable risk"" to workers.

jjmil03,"The best argument to encourage EV adoption is cost. If the car will save money, people will buy it. 90% of the population is concerned with economics. The environment is of course a factor, but normal Americans can’t take advantage of tax credits because most don’t pay $7,500 in taxes. No normal middle class person is going to spend an extra 7,500 for the environment, because they don’t have it to spend.

Once these cars all cost the same as non-EV vehicles, can be charged quickly enough, and save people money over gasoline, they will take over the market.

Stossel just did a bunch of research that shows an EV must be driven around 60,000 miles before it recoups all the environmental damage it causes in its production. And we essentially rape other countries resources and damage their environment to acquire the battery materials. That is fact, plain and simple. The article seems to be more focused on coal usage, but doesn’t really focus on the other, more pertinent aspects.

_wekko_,"I have a similar story with a different ending. I was charging in Germany when a guy pulled up next to me. He tried to connect his regular mode 2 charging cable to the fast charger. To me it was obvious he had no clue.

Even though I almost speak no German I tried my best to explain to him he had to connect the cable from the charger itself.

I wanted to pick up the cable from my car to show him I wasn’t using it as well. At that moment I bumped my head into the ‘charging only’ sign. It went right into my head and I was bleeding all over the place. 

All the guy said was: danke Schön and he drove off. 

Before you are wondering if I survived: I did. The bleeding eventually stopped and I drove another 500 miles home to clean it up. Still have a big scar on my head, but it makes me look though. If anyone asks, I fought a lion.

Anyway, moral of the story. Your own safety comes first?","<div class=""md""><p>I have a similar story with a different ending. I was charging in Germany when a guy pulled up next to me.

tonyqiu1019,"Our first charge experience with EA:

Pulled up to the parking spot, and the pavement was just conveniently located to: 1) not trigger any sensor alerts, and 2) scratch our front right bumper. I plugged in the cord, and pulled out my phone to scan the EA pass, and it did work on the first try to initiate the charging. However, the stated 150kW station was only giving us 46kW and we only charged 23% through a 30 minutes session. Being a bit rattled, we ended the charging early to drive back and take more look at the scratch at home. Several days later we checked on the EA app, the station magically went from 150kW to 50kW.

I guess all of the issues were partially on ourselves (for poor distance estimation), and partially on just bad luck. Still we love our new EV and we don’t hate EA even after this incident. We made peace with the scratch after some basic cleaning, and we are looking forward to trying out the 350kW stations in another location at some point.

Guess that makes us true “EV enthusiasts”? :D","<div class=""md""><p>Our first charge experience with EA:</p>

However, the stated 150kW station was only giving us 46kW and we only charged 23% through a 30 minutes session. Being a bit rattled, we ended the charging early to drive back and take more look at the scratch at home. Several days later we checked on the EA app, the station magically went from 150kW to 50kW.</p>

<p>I guess all of the issues were partially on ourselves (for poor distance estimation), and partially on just bad luck. Still we love our new EV and we don’t hate EA even after this incident. We made peace with the scratch after some basic cleaning, and we are looking forward to trying out the 350kW stations in another location at some point.</p>

<p>Guess that makes us true “EV enthusiasts”? :D</p>

Unlikely_Ad_1692,"I’ve had an EV since 2017 and have noticed a couple things. One is that the charger network has expanded and more importantly it has gotten more reliable. The thing that bothers me is in the past when a charger just didn’t work I was essentially stranded or because I have a gas range extender I was going often many many miles on the gas generator to the next station. 

I have a 94mA i3 with an electric range of 130 miles on a perfect day.  I needed to go to Mexico from Phoenix. No charger in Tucson worked (there were 2 at the time) and no chargers existed south of Tucson.  If I had no range extender I would have been screwed.  The thing that I really wanted at that time and maybe now still is a way to manually start a charging session.  Like if the charger doesn’t work, I want to be able to call EA and have them give me a one time algorithmic code where I can physically punch in the code and  it just starts the charge even if the station has the dreaded network error message.  
It also makes me insanely mad that chargers are often hidden in locked parking lots or far away from businesses. Why isn’t there a charger by a restaurant so I can grab a snack while I’m charging?  Or use the toilet?  I hope it changes and charging stations start adding snack vending and maybe benches and definitely rain and shade covers.","<div class=""md""><p>I’ve had an EV since 2017 and have noticed a couple things.

Temujin_123,"I sat down and calculated as best I could the ratios of operating efficiency and pollution between BEVs and ICEs for my area taking the following into account:

* engine efficiency (once fuel or charge is in vehicle)

* efficiency and pollution of different electricity generation based on the proportion of sources reported by my local energy supplier

* electricity transmission loss

* cost to transport gasoline to pumps (treating it like a ""transmission loss"")

* assuming average MPG or mi/kWh for reasonable vehicles

I did not include costs or impact of oil refinery so this would be a lower bound (EV is at least this much more efficient).

Net result is that my EV is 2.1 times more energy efficient and causes 3.5 times less CO2 pollution.

I don't have the numbers handy, but even if I changed the energy mix to 100% coal sourced it only changes to something like 1.5 times more efficient and 2.5 times less CO2 pollution.

sik_dik,"I've been arguing for decades that this is what would've made EVs take off far more rapidly, and I still believe this would be the ideal route.

how about instead of having to charge, you just pulled into a service station and they swapped your battery to a full one? the battery you got was one someone dropped off that was charged back up, just as the one you dropped off will be charged and then redistributed. you don't own the battery pack. you pay for the charge and a usage fee.

EVs are much cheaper, because nobody is buying the batteries. EVs never suffer from battery degradation, because battery maintenance is on the manufacturers. EVs drivers barely even have to change their practice, as battery stations and gas stations would effectively take the same amount of time. Current EVs wouldn't lose value when battery tech changes. New battery tech would be available to all EV drivers when it rolls out

His vision for a carbon free future within the parameters of what we have to work with in our current economic system excited me. I was an early Elon fanboy ... because I was excited about the vision he had. 

So ... not at the IPO (that would have been nice)... but at a point that was way way ago I bought a good amount of stock ... at least for a middle class American. I believed in it. I had the thought that I was going to hold on to it and then buy a Tesla with the net gain once it hit a certain amount. 

It hit that point, and then I ended up holding on to the stock past that point as I had my reservations while I watched Elon transform from civilization savior to spurned needy daddy issues right wing billionaire. Perhaps it was always there and I was blind to it, but that was my journey. I ended up selling all my stock in late 2020 for a very neat tidy profit (x14 of what I paid) and am now awaiting a delivery of my Rivian, a company/brand which captures the spirit that sold me on Tesla way way ago. And Rivian sold me with the quality of their vehicles and with a relatively boring (i.e. not about him), but still passionate CEO that under promises and over delivers. 

If it means curbing the warming of our planet, I hope for Tesla's success. But Elon is a toxic human that doesn't deserve the power and influence that he has.

red_stripe05,"I had been a huge vocal supporter of Tesla since 2008 when I first read about an electric roadster based off my favorite car at the time, the Lotus Elise. The fact Tesla was building them practically in my backyard in the Bay Area was awesome to me as well. I could never afford them, but I leased the next best thing in 2013, a Tesla battery and drivetrain inside a 2012 RAV4 EV. I was smitten and obsessed with all things Tesla and EV. 

I bought a Model 3 in 2019 when they finally became affordable. And this year I upgraded to a 2023 Model Y. Well “upgrade” should definitely be in quotes, as it’s inferior in build quality in so many ways. The “comfort” suspension I was told my car came with is not actually the latest and greatest. I’m convinced I got one but with leftover parts they found in a warehouse. The build quality and bugs that my brand new Model Y currently has is driving me sour on the brand. My 2018 Model 3 was actually quieter, smoother, and totally issue free for years. I don’t even want to drive my Model Y because I’m constantly reminded how crappy it is every time I get in it. Add all the Elon antics and BS on top of it, and I’m fairly sure I’ll never buy another Tesla product any time soon. I can’t wait to get rid of the Model Y.

JustinUti,"“I’ll never be seen in a Tesla!”, he said after setting down his Colombian coffee which most definitely isint controlled by the cartels. 

He put on his Nikes, ready for his day. There was a handwritten “save me from this place” note inside the shoebox when he opened his new package yesterday. What a funny troll from some guy at the factory, haha! 

As he walked to his car he texted to his buddy on his Apple IPhone  and loudly proclaimed “I really can’t stand that Elon guy! His politics are terrible!”, his neighbor needs to know how conscientious he is of his purchases. He heard rumors about Foxconn employees jumping to their suicide at the factory, but they installed nets so they don’t splatter on the pavement into a symphony of blood and guts. Now that’s a company looking out for people! 

As he stepped into his vehicle, he took a sip from his “Nestle-processed sugar beverage”. Ahh, that’s good stuff! I wonder how they source and who owns this water supply, he asked himself. He brushed that curiosity from his mind. 

He turned on his Volkswagen. Just a few years ago he had to have some parts changed out because of an emissions scandal. Fuck Elon! I hate that guy! He always is screwing over everyone, I know better than to purchase his products! He turned on his VW and headed to work.","<div class=""md""><p>“I’ll never be seen in a Tesla!”, he said after setting down his Colombian coffee which most definitely isint controlled by the cartels. </p>

CommanderCanuck22,"I really have been having to think about which truck I want between the two of them. 

I have an order in for both. I live in Canada and the starting price for the lightning up here is 68 000 dollars. Which puts it at a bit more expensive than the mid range Cybertruck. After doing a ton of reading about the lightning, it seems the 68 000 dollar version has their smaller battery in it. Which means the lightning can only travel 360 km on a full battery. Whereas the Cybertruck can travel 480 km on a full battery for slightly less in price. 

That difference in range is huge and tips the favour back towards the Cybertruck for me. But I spent the last few days really agonizing over making a choice. I will keep both orders for now. But if the smaller battery is all I can get without cranking the price way up, the Lightning just won’t be worth it unfortunately.","<div class=""md""><p>I really have been having to think about which truck I want between the two of them. </p>

upL8N8,"I've had a PHEV (Chevy Volt) for 4 years now w/ 32.5k miles.  (Below average miles due to COVID) 90% of miles are electric and were charged with the included level 1 travel charger with no need to run a pricey 220V line to my garage.  People be installing $1000-$2000 220V lines to their garages and then talking about ""But PHEVs have such higher maintenance costs than BEVs, like annual oil changes!""... :rolling_on_the_floor_laughing:  After 4 years, I've had two oil changes... both were free from GM.  They normally cost about $50.  (My tires and brakes still have loads of life left on them too)

I've driven about 3250 miles using gasoline at an average of about 40 mpg; probably closer to 41-42 mpg.  In 4 years, I've used \~80 gallons of gas, or 20 gallons per year on average.  A comparable 35 mpg ICEV would have used 232 gallons per year.  Obviously I've used quite a bit of electricity as well, which in my state has a not-insignificant carbon cost.

I've only charged the car twice outside of my house; that was at a hotel with free charging.

All road trips have had 2-3 passengers, so most gas use was split between multiple passengers.

(I plan to start offsetting my driven miles with PEV miles every chance I get; EUCs being my PEV of choice... IMO if a person believes in and is worried about man made climate change, they should probably be trying to do the same.  A PEV can get 20-40 miles per kWh versus a BEV's 2-5 miles per kWh.  And yes... it's faster and more fun to travel on a PEV in California / New York in rush hour traffic than in a car.)

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Reminder:

In 2022, due to battery cell supply constraints, if all PHEV batteries (assuming 15 kWh on average) had all been used to build 70 kWh long range EVs (on average), then the number of plug in EVs sold globally would have dropped from \~10.6 million to \~8.6 million. (ICEVs would increase from 69.4 million to 71.4 million assuming 80 million per year)

Assuming all BEVs were 70 kWh on average, and all of their batteries had been used to build 15 kWh PHEVs and 1 kWh HEVs, we could have produced 36.5 million PHEVs and 45 million HEVs last year... potentially making every new car produced globally either a PHEV or HEV.

By the time we double battery cell production and reached the production of 16.4 million 70 kWh BEVs per year (and 64 million ICEVs), we could already be producing 80 million 15 kWh PHEVs, replacing the production of all new ICEVs with plug-in electrics globally.

To hit that target, it would require zero DC fast charging infrastructure.

Then... maybe 10 years down the road when battery tech has advanced, standards and charging strategies have been carefully thought through and planned, and we have excess battery cell capacity, that's when we could start transitioning PHEV production to BEV production with excess cells.

I don't think it can be made any more clear that the charge lead by Tesla and domestic / international governments have taken us down the wrong transitional path.  For what... stonk gains?  For greed?  You know who loves the current administrations pathway?  Tesla shareholders and oil executives / shareholders... because concentrating extremely limited battery cell resources on large battery long range BEVs is by far the slowest way to transition to plug-in electrics and away from oil.

And that's just looking at 70 kWh cars.  As we know, the trend recently is to start  pumping out larger battery SUVs and pickup trucks.  F-150Ls with 125 kWh.  Rivians with 135 kWh.  GM trucks / SUVs with 200 kWh.  Cybertrucks with at least 100 kWh.  etc...

Tesla shareholders and oil executives / shareholders... because concentrating extremely limited battery cell resources on large battery long range BEVs is by far the slowest way to transition to plug-in electrics and away from oil.</p>

<p>And that&#39;s just looking at 70 kWh cars.  As we know, the trend recently is to start  pumping out larger battery SUVs and pickup trucks.  F-150Ls with 125 kWh.  Rivians with 135 kWh.  GM trucks / SUVs with 200 kWh.  Cybertrucks with at least 100 kWh.  etc...</p>

<p>Good job team.</p>

franzn,I've owned my polestar since last November and I had to charge about twice because my on board charger died.

GuyOnRedditBored,"I agree, a lot of news articles on EVs largely center around issues or pains of DC fast charging. However, in reality, many owners rarely if ever use a DC fast charger. 

We used it fairly often in the beginning, mainly because due to Covid shortages our chargepoint home flex took nearly 2 months to come after ordering through our utility company due to rebate.

My wife drives over 100 miles a day for work, and charging on the standard outlet only gave us around 35-40 miles of range overnight. She has a standard range MachE AWD and gets around 210 miles on a full charge, so after 3 days she would need to dc fast charge. 

Our experience has actually been flawless at electrify America. I’m not sure if it’s because Ford specifically supports plug and charge, but we used our free 500kw balance and never had to fumble with an app, literally just plug and charge. 

Thankfully the charger finally came right about when our dc fast charge bundle was finished (only had to pay for a few days of charging). My wife was starting to lose patience having to dc fast charge every 3 days and wait about 20-30 minutes charging after work and second guess if getting an EV was a right decision. It’s also crazy expensive and won’t save any money vs a gas car if you need to rely on public fast charging to charge your EV. 

However, after getting the charger installed, the experience has been fantastic. We’ve had the car about a year now and just the other week my wife casually mentioned how she hasn’t been to a gas station in forever and kind of misses it. Lol. Those feelings quickly go away though when you get to a pre-conditioned car and just are able to go to and from your destination with no stops for gas, or if in a rush and forgot to get gas the night before being late. 

The only other time in the last year after getting the home charger installed that we used super chargers were on a road trip to upstate Ny (we live on LI). We stopped at 2 electrify America stops on the way there, partly because we love the convenience and ease of plug and charge, but also because they were the most convenient / well placed along our route, and then the same 2 on the way home. No issues or complaints, each stop we were ready for a restroom break and some food and refreshments, so barely took any extra time either.","<div class=""md""><p>I agree, a lot of news articles on EVs largely center around issues or pains of DC fast charging.

Aquareon,"When you suggest people with not much income switch to unusually expensive cars (so far as they know) as a solution to high gas prices, it comes off as a bougie flex. It's like vegans lecturing poor people about meat consumption and processed foods when due to artificial economic conditions surrounding the meat industry in the US, meat is cheaper than salad, and processed foods are both affordable and keep for longer than fresh foods.

A better approach might be to showcase cheap used EVs and PHEVs being sold on autotrader in your area. Often people with no EV experience see the high sticker price of new EVs and assume for some reason that there is no used EV market, so the new prices are simply the cost of entry into EVs. Many such people I have argued with were blown away to hear that they could buy a used Spark for around 5 or 6 grand, or a used Volt for 7 grand. They had no idea.

Then they usually raise concerns about battery longevity, because their only knowledge of that topic is horror stories they have heard about the Leaf, which has an unusually short lived battery due to the absence of thermal management (apart from fans). When they see real world data confirming a long lifespan for liquid cooled batteries, it helps change their mind about EV technology.

I have talked several people into buying used EVs by this method who would previously not have considered it. Much of the opposition to EVs is sour grapes by people who think they will never be able to afford one. So, they come up with reasons why EVs are bad anyway, so they won't be bothered by that. Hence they only remember negative things they hear about EVs (price, Leaf battery longevity, Tesla fires) and ignore anything good, or they never hear anything good because their chosen media sources are all anti-EV. Polite, patient education is the solution here imo.","<div class=""md""><p>When you suggest people with not much income switch to unusually expensive cars (so far as they know) as a solution to high gas prices, it comes off as a bougie flex.

Polite, patient education is the solution here imo.</p>

PolarEV,"Alberta EV owner here. I saw this photo and my heart bleeds for you. 

I understand the toxic oil culture and its impact on those of us who have chosen to drive a more environmentally responsible vehicle. In the early days of my ownership I would be openly harassed on and off the road and regularly find my vehicle unplugged, cord taken, or side of the car keyed. Trucks have even tried to run me off the road. It is absolutely absurd and incredibly frustrating. 

This is what I have put in place over the last few months.

At home, I charge outdoors in a driveway. I have two visible external cameras pointed at the driveway with blinking lights, two motion sensitive lights, and signage that the area is being monitored.

I de-badged my vehicle. There is no advertising what make or model the car is. 

I purchased a heavy duty cable protection ramp cover and run the charging cord through it before I park on top of it while I charge it. So even if someone unplugs it, they cannot walk away with the cord. This also allows me to keep the cord relatively taut with minimal room for petro sexual knuckle draggers to play.

I put a personal effect hanging from my mirror to remind other people that I am not a malicious monster and am indeed human :green_heart:

I am so sorry that this happened to you. I hope in the near future these incidents (what I assume to be ridiculous acts of hate) become a scarcity and not the norm in O&G territory.","<div class=""md""><p>Alberta EV owner here. I saw this photo and my heart bleeds for you. </p>

2024 Hyundai Ioniq 6 First Look: A Striking, Swoopy Stake in the Electric Car Ground

  
One more step in Hyundai’s relentless march toward mainstream EV domination.

  
Angus MacKenzieWriter

&#x200B;

Tesla might grab the headlines, but Hyundai Motor Group is the quiet achiever in the race for domination of the EV mass market in America. Thanks to well-built, well-equipped, and well-priced models such as the Hyundai Ioniq 5 and Kona Electric, the Kia EV6 and Niro EV, and the newly launched Genesis GV60, Hyundai Motor Group snared the No. 2 spot in the U.S. electric vehicle market earlier this year, ahead of Ford, Nissan, and Volkswagen.  
  
To be sure, Hyundai Motor Group is still a long, long way behind Tesla in terms of overall EV sales numbers. But there's no denying the company's soaring ambition in the segment.  
  
The Hyundai Ioniq 6, which goes on sale here in the first half of 2023, marks one more step in a relentless march that will see Hyundai spend $16 billion on launching more than 30 EV models by 2030 as it targets electric vehicle sales of 3 million vehicles a year.  
  
The company is also spending $5.54 billion on its first dedicated EV factory, to be built near Savannah, Georgia. The factory will be designed to produce up to six EV models for the U.S. market by 2028, including the yet-to-be-seen Hyundai Ioniq 7, a roomy three-row electric SUV that should arrive for 2024, as well a Kia EV pickup reportedly set to go on sale in the first half of 2026.  
  
But first, meet the Ioniq 6.  
  
In simple terms, the Ioniq 6 is the production version of the swoopy Prophecy concept unveiled in 2020. Under the skin is Hyundai Motor Group's impressive E-GMP EV platform, which underpins both the Hyundai Ioniq 5 and Kia's EV6 and features the company's fast-charging 800-volt electrical architecture.  
  
  
  
Hyundai Ioniq 6 Power And Battery Capacity  
Hyundai hasn't announced powertrain details yet, but it's logical to assume the Ioniq 6 will come with the same electric motor and battery pack configurations as the Ioniq 5. That means a rear-drive model with a 225-hp, 258-lb-ft motor powered by a choice of 58-kWh or 77.4-kWh battery packs, plus an AWD model with the bigger battery pack and a 99-hp, 188-lb-ft motor at the front axle to bring the total output to 320 hp and 446 lb-ft.  
  
The Ioniq 6 measures 116.1 inches between the axles, neatly splitting the difference between the Ioniq 5, which has a 118.1-inch wheelbase, and the EV6, which rolls on a 114.1-inch wheelbase. The original plan had been for the Ioniq 6 to share the EV6's wheelbase, Hyundai Styling Group head Simon Loasby says, but the designers fought hard for the extra inches to improve the car's proportions.  
  
The wheelbase stretch delivered one other important benefit: more room for rear passengers. Although 5 inches shorter overall than a Honda Accord, the Ioniq 6 boasts almost limousine levels of rear knee- and legroom, though the battery pack means the seat bottom is closer to the flat floor than in a vehicle with an internal combustion engine.  
  
  
  
Cool Design Details, Historic Inspiration  
One of the original names considered for the Ioniq 6 was Streamliner, Hyundai's head of global design, SangYup Lee, says. ""We decided on Ioniq 6, but I always see a Streamliner badge underneath,"" jokes Lee, who referenced images of iconic wind-cheating cars such as the Stout Scarab and Phantom Corsair from the late 1930s and the 1947 Saab 92 during the media preview for the new Hyundai.  
  
""It's a simple, reductive design,"" Lee says of the Ioniq 6's slippery silhouette, with its low hood, cab-forward stance, and swooping greenhouse. ""It's a pure volume, a proportion you cannot do with an internal combustion engine vehicle.""  
  
And it doesn't just look like a wind cheater: Every surface of the Ioniq 6 has been honed in the wind tunnel to help deliver a claimed drag coefficient of 0.21, which would make the Ioniq 6 as slippery as a Tesla Model 3.  
  
Cool details abound. The top element of the rear end, which vaguely echoes the form of a vintage Porsche 911's whale tail spoiler, has a pixel light graphic that rolls over onto its upper surface. The way the rear fenders flow inward toward the upper surface of the trunklid recalls forms found on both old 911s and a Bangle-era BMW 6 Series. Lee's team tried everything to get rid of the shark-fin antenna on the roof, but when they found they couldn't for technical reasons, they made it from a dark, translucent material so you can glimpse the electronic hardware within.  
  
But the relentless pursuit of the streamliner ethic has resulted in a couple of awkward design details, like the cutline in the C-pillar, an inevitable byproduct of the need to have a trunklid that extends to the top of the rear fenders. Then there's the way the rear door cutline extends into roof side rails to allow for the framed door uppers, done to improve rear entry and egress. They're minor quibbles, and on a dark-colored car, they won't be noticeable. In person, the Ioniq 6 has a striking presence.  
  
  
  
Examining The Ioniq 6'S Interior  
The Ioniq 6's spacious, well-equipped interior has a premium ambience that makes Volkswagen's ID4 interior look cheap and all the Tesla cabins look spartan. Variable ambient lighting is standard, but the light is bounced off the surfaces of the door panels, so you don't see the light sources. There's no Hyundai emblem on the steering wheel, just four pixels that change color: white when voice activation is used and green to show the car is charging.  
  
The digital instrument panel is a 12.0-inch display, with a second 12.0-inch touchscreen for the infotainment system above the center console. As America will get conventional rearview mirrors rather than the cameras available in other markets, there won't be screens on the wings that flare up at either end of the dash. Two interior trims will be available, both using a variety of sustainable materials, including fabrics from recycled plastics, recycled fishing net carpets, and leather dyed using flaxseed oil.  
  
Hyundai is offering a total of 12 exterior paint colors on the Ioniq 6, including gold and green matte finishes that use bamboo charcoal pigments, though it's not certain how many of these will make it stateside. Depending on spec, the Ioniq 6 will be fitted with either 18-inch wheels and 225/55 tires or 20-inch wheels with 245/40 tires.  
  
Hyundai sources say the Ioniq 6 will be priced under the smaller Tesla Model 3 when it goes on sale next year, which suggests a starting price of less than $48,000 for the entry-level rear-drive model. Hyundai considers Tesla a luxury brand, and in terms of its pricing and customer perception in the U.S., that's a fair assumption. But the Ioniq 6, which is a Model 3 and Model S tweener in terms of its overall size with a roomier back seat than either, looks just as upscale as either of Elon's sedans.  
  
It also looks to be a great value and another head-turning design, both of which are quickly becoming Ioniq brand calling cards.","<div class=""md""><p>If anyone wants to read the article: </p>

roguensquirmy,I don't get the people who think this and the likes of the ID3 are good looking cars. They're boxes on wheels. An electric car could be so much more stylish. They're not limited by the big engine in the front and should probably be more aerodynamic. They don't need to look like a van with windows. I wouldn't buy one based just on looks. I'm looking for a BEV and obviously the Tesla's are good looking but not affordable. Hyundai seem to be making good looking cars and the new Leaf and Zoe are good enough looking too.

Aurori_Swe,"I was at the IAA exhibition during the weekend and up until Tuesday. The focus on electrification is real.

It's really amazing where we are going with this and the tech is only getting better from here on out.

I also saw that BMW says that they COULD give users 1000 km range but don't really see the need for it but rather wants to focus on charging speed and after owning my EV6 gor a few months now I agree, we don't need super long range, we need longer range than now for sure, but charging speed and cost is the 2 major bottlenecks for me.","<div class=""md""><p>I was at the IAA exhibition during the weekend and up until Tuesday.

3) and frankly I should lead with this:  the egmp cars don't charge fast at all on V3 superchargers (the ones which have been retrofitted with magic docks so far).  It has to do with voltage and max current mismatches.  So until more V4 superchargers start opening up in my area, I'm not going to feel like I'm missing out here.

upL8N8,"Is this suggesting that Tesla will stop installations of their Magic docks, forcing OEMs to buy adapters for every vehicle they produce?  If so... then I was under the impression that an agreement between the current administration and Tesla had already been made.  Is Tesla going back on its word and won't be opening their network to other OEMs, unless the OEM signs an agreement with Tesla and installs their software/hardware in their cars?

Oof... what a can of worms this could open.

Ford didn't say they were doing away with the CCS plug on their cars, just that they'd be adding NACS plugs.  I'm guessing that means they'll be adding both for now. If they are getting rid of CCS plugs, then they'll still need CCS adapters, which... they'd buy from Tesla?  Their direct competitor?  Either way, they're doubling the number of connectors that need to be produced for each of their vehicles.

I wonder which solution is better for the environment.

* 18k magic docks to replace all of Tesla's charging plugs.
* Potentially millions of adapters.  

Hmmm....

Ford did say they'd be installing Tesla software on their vehicles.  As I've explained many times before, Tesla's stations are so simple because the billing software is installed in their cars, not on their chargers, allowing them to avoid adding complex billing hardware/software on their chargers requiring a constant internet connection.  Instead, the car is what tracks the transaction and submits the data to Tesla servers periodically, who's keeping the owners credit card information on record and submits the transaction.

It's also been a hypothesis of mine that this was one of the main reasons other OEMs would never agree to use Tesla's network; because they'd need to install Tesla made hardware and software in their cars, paying Tesla for the privilege of using Tesla chargers and also paying Tesla for electricity, all while potentially providing valuable customer data to Tesla.  It's one thing to support a third party network who has no skin in the automotive manufacturing game... it's another to support your direct competition.","<div class=""md""><p>Is this suggesting that Tesla will stop installations of their Magic docks, forcing OEMs to buy adapters for every vehicle they produce?

<p>It&#39;s also been a hypothesis of mine that this was one of the main reasons other OEMs would never agree to use Tesla&#39;s network; because they&#39;d need to install Tesla made hardware and software in their cars, paying Tesla for the privilege of using Tesla chargers and also paying Tesla for electricity, all while potentially providing valuable customer data to Tesla.  It&#39;s one thing to support a third party network who has no skin in the automotive manufacturing game... it&#39;s another to support your direct competition.</p>

People wonder about how effective these trucks will operate and that is entirely up to the driver. The drivers are pretty much in a time table race to complete their daily route and get home. How that effects braking? Well if they can load the truck heavier and have capacity they can go farther through their route before returning to the facility to dump. A heavier truck is harder on the brakes. The trucks aren’t hitting highway scales and are typically rated up to 54,000 pounds. Depending on type of garbage, lots of liquids particularly will increase the weight.","<div class=""md""><p>I think the best thing about this from an operator’s standing is the engine under the cab isn’t heating up the cab an insane amount.

If this kind of movement is allowed to continue we'll be in for a true depression, not a recession and not simple inflation, but a true depression. The people simply can't afford these outrageous and unnecessary regulations and changes, which in turn cause prices for everything to skyrocket. We recently got news from multiple suppliers of 20-40% increase in our equipment field. But working people aren't getting 20-40% increase in their pay. So how about the government doing something constructive like freezing supply costs at 2019 levels. They did it with gasoline to stabilize the market in the '70s, and it worked. And yet the lemmings are looking to the government to save the planet. Why bother if you can't afford to live on it.  

Wake up people, we aren't causing what the earth is going through. We can't stop it either. It's a cycle we have never seen because we most likely weren't recording history last time it happened.","<div class=""md""><p>Biden is nuts, and far more dangerous than Obama and Trump combined.

Teejaye1100,"I think the price alone is my biggest takeaway. The price is very good starting out. $40k before tax incentives? Yup, not bad. Then factor in people who love the brand and want a truck, $32/$35k looks very good to those consumers. 

I’m not too concerned with the range, let’s be honest here, average folks with trucks aren’t going long distances every day and they sure aren’t hauling heavy loads around daily either. The range will be just fine. 

Big picture tho, this is a shot at Tesla point blank. Ford came with it, next up GM, then Honda,Toyota, Volkswagen ID.4 and others who are coming guns blazing. The pie is about to be cut up and I don’t think within the next 2/3 years Tesla will have those expensive prices around for much longer. The hype will die down. Seems like it already is in a sense.

TangerineEffective30,"So how much does one save on fuel a year ?

A regular F-150 gets what, 17 mpg? Someone driving 80 miles a work day , would use 5 gallons of gas a day.  Cost of fuel is maybe $2.75 post pandemic?  So that's $13.75 of fuel cost a day for someone that has a solid commute. 

How many kwh will someone use for 80 mile commute day in just announced vehicle?  50 khw per day?

So in some states, incremental electricity is what? $0.20/khw? ball park? (I know its higher in north east states like NY / CT).  So this person that uses 50 kwh a day would pay $10.00.

So someone would say $3.75 a day in fuel ($13.75 - $10.00); x 300 working days = $1,125 a year, before considering casual driving on weekends?  

That sound about right?  Anything way off with my math? Seems like this would sell really well then.","<div class=""md""><p>So how much does one save on fuel a year ?</p>

deck_hand,"I mean, yeah.  I did some math over the years  on my 2013 Nissan Leaf.   The sticker price was $34,000.  I got it on a lease at $400 a month for 2 years ($9600), but I got half of the federal incentive and all of my state tax break of $5000.  So the $9600 became  $850 over the first two years.  

The car it replaced got 20 miles to the gallon at an average of about $2.50 a gallon, so about $0.125 per mile driven. I charged the car at night, during the Super-off-peak pricing of 2.6 cents per kilowatt-hour, and I got more than 4 miles to the kilowatt-hour, so I was getting a cost of around half a cent per mile for electricity. That saved me nearly 12 cents per mile, and I drove the car about 20,000 miles in the first 2 years of owning it.  That's a savings of $130.

So, the cost of owning my Leaf over the first 2 years was only $720.  I bought the contract out after two years for $10,000, and we've driven it nearly 90,000 miles over the course of the last 10 years.  For about half of those years, I've been able to charge it for free or so cheap that we don't even notice it on our electricity bill.  There have been no oil changes, no radiator flushes, no oxygen sensor replacements or fuel filters.  I haven't even replaced the brake pads - I just got them checked, again, and the shop said they are still fine.

Over the life of the car at this point, it's cost me $89 per month, plus insurance. I laugh every time someone says that electric cars are too expensive.","<div class=""md""><p>I mean, yeah.

Yes, they included HEVs and PHEVs with the BEVs in this study. HEVs and BEVs are more than twice the number of BEVs.

They however tried to exclude arson.

Hence, more ICE catch fire.

But wait, probability: EVs catch fire 10% of the time, whereas only 6% of the ICE catch fire. This was based on theoretical total numbers of each.

Numbers can be made to say a lot. These are just examples.

skyfex,"Did the same 5 years ago, with the Soul EV,  and considering upgrading to Ioniq 5 now. I feel like it's a spiritual successor.. the Soul was lik a Tardis (or a clown car): bigger on the inside, could always fit a surprising amount of stuff in it (with the seats down at least). I got the same feeling with the Ioniq 5. Side-by-side the Soul EV it looked smaller actually, but it's obviously not. Felt much smaller than Enyaq and ID.4 when driving it, even though it's about the same with even more cargo space.

There's a less to think/worry about with an EV when it comes to the engine, and it's really nice I never had to fill my brain with that stuff (other than some residual stuff from driving my parents cars.. but I know I'm the kind of person to really get into how the engine works and how to properly maintain it if I actually owned an ICEV). On the other hand I've probably filled my head with at least as much information related to fast chargers, which is silly since I use it like 10 times a year, max. It really shouldn't be that complicated. I hope that improves over time. 

I hope the Ioniq 5 gets some OTA with real feature improvements, then it'd be nearly perfect in my opinion. Unfortunately that's impossible to know ahead of time.","<div class=""md""><p>Did the same 5 years ago, with the Soul EV,  and considering upgrading to Ioniq 5 now.

There is only the one bad report in the last few days, (perhaps that is yours).    


I am skeptical whether negative reports work that well or not, but I'd like to think they do somewhat.  The fact that plugshare lists it as under repair is not the last word on whether negative reports should be left there.  EA apparently really dropped the ball so badly on this one that they should not (IMO) get a pass on the amount of time it will take them to get this back up.  Furthermore, there is at least one other report in this topic that this particular station is down a lot.  Multiple negative reports serve to drive down the score and warn other drivers.

I don't love everything about Tesla, but in my view Tesla would likely repair such a key station location very quickly, as they seem to be, over the years, far more motivated to help drivers avoid having these sorts of difficulties.  Still, on at least one occasion I've had enough of an issue with a Tesla supercharger to leave a negative review.  I think there's too much ""grade inflation"" that goes on.

improvius,"It's all about profit. Places like gas stations and truck stops have a direct line between working pumps and day-to-day net income. If people have problems fueling at one location, they'll immediately go somewhere else to fill up (and buy a coke, hot dog, snacks, smokes, etc.). And that immediately affects the business's bottom line. 

With EA (and other charging networks), though, that sort of immediacy/urgency doesn't exist. I think they don't make that much profit (if any) from the individuals stopping to charge every day. I think most of the incoming funds come from places like government grants, subscriptions, partnership deals with EV manufacturers, and stuff like that. Stuff that isn't immediately dependent on whether or not a given charging station is working on a given day.  
  
Tesla would be the exception, of course. But the supercharger network is a huge part of their brand identity and perceived value.

ToddA1966,"Yep! Until that one broken station in that one place gets fixed, EVs are useless! :beaming_face_with_smiling_eyes:

Kidding aside, while I get the frustration, why are you connecting ""Electrify America"" with EV growth?

We don't have 275,000,000 gas cars in the USA because just Exxon was successful. We have dozens of competitive gas stations and convenience store brands to choose from. 

We need a robust nationwide charging infrastructure made up of a variety of healthy competitors. Not just put all of our eggs in one dieselgate settlement basket! If the EA station is broken, go use EVGo or ChargePoint. (Yes, I realize that's not an option in every area, but if that's the case in your area *that's* the problem that actually needs addressing more than EA's reliability! How is your state spending its discretionary Dieselgate funds? What is your state's NEVI plan? Where are all of the chargers your state was given funding to subsidize?)

I've done several 1000+ mile EV road trips. My first was in a Nissan Leaf, where I attempted (but failed!) to make the trip without using EA at all (as a middle finger to EA for its accelerated depreciation of Chademo.) If an EA station was broken (with the Leaf there's only one Chademo charger available regardless of how many working chargers there are) I just used a different charger (sadly the one time that happened the closest charger was also an EA!)

Of course I was fortunate to be in an area with adequate infrastructure, I realize not everyone is. You can't swing an extension cord without hitting a charger on I-70 through Colorado. And Utah, with a little less infrastructure than Colorado, operates a few free DC chargers along the highway courtesy their Dept of Transportation.

But again, this isn't an ""EA""  problem. This is a ""some states not giving enough a sh!t to do their job"" problem. I think West Virginia put their Dieselgate money in a box and buried it in their deepest coal mine because they'd rather see it go unused than fund a charger program for ""wokemobiles"".","<div class=""md""><p>Yep!

How is your state spending its discretionary Dieselgate funds? What is your state&#39;s NEVI plan? Where are all of the chargers your state was given funding to subsidize?)</p>

<p>I&#39;ve done several 1000+ mile EV road trips. My first was in a Nissan Leaf, where I attempted (but failed!) to make the trip without using EA at all (as a middle finger to EA for its accelerated depreciation of Chademo.) If an EA station was broken (with the Leaf there&#39;s only one Chademo charger available regardless of how many working chargers there are) I just used a different charger (sadly the one time that happened the closest charger was also an EA!)</p>

<p>Of course I was fortunate to be in an area with adequate infrastructure, I realize not everyone is. You can&#39;t swing an extension cord without hitting a charger on I-70 through Colorado. And Utah, with a little less infrastructure than Colorado, operates a few free DC chargers along the highway courtesy their Dept of Transportation.</p>

<p>But again, this isn&#39;t an &quot;EA&quot;  problem. This is a &quot;some states not giving enough a sh!t to do their job&quot; problem. I think West Virginia put their Dieselgate money in a box and buried it in their deepest coal mine because they&#39;d rather see it go unused than fund a charger program for &quot;wokemobiles&quot;.</p>

vandy1981,">Electrify America is preventing electric car growth in US

I'm sorry, but this is a ridiculous statement. The reliability isn't where it needs to be, but there's no way there would be a viable CCS vehicle market in the USA without EA and dieselgate..

You are mistaken if you think a company would have stepped up to start construction of an expensive charging network for CCS vehicles starting in 2019.  There definitely would not be any chargers in places like Lafayette.

Also, there are 4 EA chargers in West Lafayette.  I'm not sure where you're getting the impression that there are 8 chargers.","<div class=""md""><blockquote>

* They pretty much only install in groups of 4 or more. While it could be better, competitors like EVGo and Shell Recharge often only have 1 or 2 chargers per location.

* Charging station design. While their first generation chargers leave a lot to be desired, their newer pull-through locations, with the long charging cables that come from above.

folks were arriving to find many of the chargers not working, and then a lot of people were running out of battery waiting for the ones that were.

Some people say that range anxiety and road trips are not the norm for electric cars, they are corner cases and thus fast charging experience is not something the OEM should be involved with aside from providing the capability to receive the best charging rate. In my opinion, Tesla is lightyears ahead of traditional OEMs because they valued the entire EV customer experience and realized that fast charging is a critical use case within that experience.

Perhaps they wish to but the settlement terms didn't include provisions on maintenance.

E-A prices for charging are \~30% less than Tesla, which suggests they aren't making much profit, if any, given that Tesla said their Superchargers would ""never be a profit center"".

bhauertso,"> Until this gets figured out, electric cars will be limited, period.

This is the second time I've seen this sentiment on this subreddit. It's a blinkered point of view that willfully ignores that Electrify America has no power whatsoever to hold back the company that manufacturers and sells the overwhelming majority of electric vehicles in the United states, Tesla.

Considering Tesla plans to grow production by an average of 50% annually for the next several years, that reality is unlikely to change any time soon. Yes, Electrify America's (deliberate?) incompetence will be an annoyance for customers of manufacturers that refuse to work with Tesla to adopt NACS and Supercharger membership. But ultimately, EA's ineptitude and indolence will not be an overpowering headwind as this post suggests—EA's reach is simply too limited.","<div class=""md""><blockquote>

Though they certainly deserve a lot of credit for 3 point seat belts and their overall safety approach, they were actually slow amongst European manufacturers to offer standard airbags.

But how do you respond? How accurate are those claims? Where do they get this from? And where could I start learning about the impacts—good and bad—of electrification? 

I’m guessing a lot of you here know more than me, so hoping you can help me understand.

Cities all over the world have successfully banned all cars and motorcycles in areas of the city to open the roads to only pedestrians and bikes.  It has been extremely successful in changing the roads of the city where cars used to be parked or just sitting in traffic into beautiful wooded areas with cafes, restaurants and social gather places that has increased the social health and vitality of the communities.  I believe in the next 1000 years that all progessive cities will completely ban cars and other vehicles in favor of subways, monorails, street trains, trees, greenways, cafes, restaurants, pedestrians and bikes.  And people will vote with their wallets and move to the cities that offer this new incredible way of bringing community back by getting rid of 2 ton metal boxes for transporting one person that have destroyed our communities and civilization our biosphere and created landfills that continue to grow and grow and poison our ground water, rivers and oceans with toxic batteries and tires.

TheMacAttk,"\* I am not a mathematician so please double check my numbers for those inclined.\*

As much as I disagree with the Hummer EV, the environmental tradeoff vs an H2 is enormous. 24kWh to travel 50 miles is the energy equivalent of using about 0.7 gallons of gas and actually appears to far exceed it's EPA rating of 47MPGe combined. Now, compare that to an ICE variant of the H2 which seems to average around 10mpg and we're talking about an \~85% decrease in energy use. 

In the end, it's far more energy than SHOULD be used, but converting these glutinous monsters over to electric is still a small win.","<div class=""md""><p>* I am not a mathematician so please double check my numbers for those inclined.*</p>

HighTechButter,"Everyone realizes this horrible metrics are used to manipulate the dumb that ‘EVs are bad’.  As dumb as this vehicle is, it’s still way more ‘efficient’ to fuel.

Magic_Bullets,"Then again the energy used burning 5 gallons of gas could power 5-10 homes for a day.

To calculate the energy content in 5 gallons of gasoline, we need to know the energy content per gallon of gasoline and then convert it to both British thermal units (BTU) and kilowatt-hours (kWh).

1. **Energy Content of Gasoline:** A gallon of gasoline typically contains about 114,000 BTU of energy. 

2. **Energy in 5 Gallons of Gasoline in BTU:** To find the total energy content in BTUs, we multiply the energy per gallon by 5:
   \[ 114,000 \text{ BTU/gallon} \times 5 \text{ gallons} = 570,000 \text{ BTU} \]

3. **Converting BTU to kWh:** To convert BTUs to kWh, we use the conversion factor where 1 kWh is equivalent to 3,412 BTU. So, the energy in kWh for 5 gallons of gasoline is:
   \[ \frac{570,000 \text{ BTU}}{3,412 \text{ BTU/kWh}} \approx 167 \text{ kWh} \]

Therefore, 5 gallons of gasoline contain approximately 570,000 BTU or about 167 kWh of energy. This calculation provides a rough estimate, as the actual energy content can vary slightly based on the specific formulation of the gasoline.","<div class=""md""><p>Then again the energy used burning 5 gallons of gas could power 5-10 homes for a day.</p>

<p>To calculate the energy content in 5 gallons of gasoline, we need to know the energy content per gallon of gasoline and then convert it to both British thermal units (BTU) and kilowatt-hours (kWh).</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Energy Content of Gasoline:</strong> A gallon of gasoline typically contains about 114,000 BTU of energy. </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Energy in 5 Gallons of Gasoline in BTU:</strong> To find the total energy content in BTUs, we multiply the energy per gallon by 5:
[ 114,000 \text{ BTU/gallon} \times 5 \text{ gallons} = 570,000 \text{ BTU} ]</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Converting BTU to kWh:</strong> To convert BTUs to kWh, we use the conversion factor where 1 kWh is equivalent to 3,412 BTU. So, the energy in kWh for 5 gallons of gasoline is:
[ \frac{570,000 \text{ BTU}}{3,412 \text{ BTU/kWh}} \approx 167 \text{ kWh} ]</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Therefore, 5 gallons of gasoline contain approximately 570,000 BTU or about 167 kWh of energy. This calculation provides a rough estimate, as the actual energy content can vary slightly based on the specific formulation of the gasoline.</p>

FANGO,"Just posted this in another thread today:

For all the people who are interested in EVs but do not drive one, let me tell you one of the side benefits of an EV that it took me a while to notice: I literally have no idea what gas prices are at any given point.  I never notice the signs, they just don't even enter my brain.  It's completely useless information to me so my brain just doesn't attach any importance to it at all.

In my first stint of driving electric, which was a lease and I was stuck back on gas a little while after it, I didn't look at any gas stations at all.  When I went back to gas for a few months, one of the first things I had to do was stop at the gas station down the street from my house, the one I had always gone to since it was so convenient.  I pulled up and look out the window and I'm next to an ATM, not a gas pump.  The damn thing had been demolished and turned into a bank and I didn't even notice.  It was just that far away from my mind for several years.

Given how much time people spend thinking about this, to the point where there are conversations, everyone keeps that up to date piece of information in their head, changes their daily schedule based on whether they expect prices to go up or down or which stations nearby have the lowest prices, etc., it's freeing just not to have to spend any RAM space or processor cycles on that.  People have this strange idea that EVs are less convenient, but it's very convenient not to have to think about any of that.","<div class=""md""><p>Just posted this in another thread today:</p>

SirEDCaLot,"There's a few reasons.  

The first is to hold public interest.  Why do you think there's Pepsi ads that just say 'Pepsi' and nothing else?  Why do companies pay millions to plaster their logo everywhere?  Not even an ad, just a logo?  To keep themselves in your mind.  

The reason for this is twofold.  The first is more for low and mid range cars- so when it's time to get a car, you think of that company.  Hopefully with a positive impression.  Maybe 3-4 months down the road you'll need a car and remember that superbowl ad with the flashy EV.  

The second is reinforcement.  This is more for luxury cars.  Most luxury car ads aren't actually to sell cars- they are to reinforce the purchase decision of someone who's either already planning to buy, or has recently ordered.  That person WANTS to see that they just made the right choice, and the ad gives them exactly what they want--  you chose right, this car has the best technology and whatever.  

Then of course is the simple fact that they have the ad budget and aren't going to NOT spend it.  If they advertise ICE cars they will seem outdated (since everyone else is pushing EVs).  So they spend it.  

And let's not forget a lot of people will go to a dealer looking for an EV and get talked into an ICE car or hybrid.","<div class=""md""><p>There&#39;s a few reasons.  </p>

magnusssdad,"I think this is a good honest effort out of Ford and I am pleasantly surprised with the pricing. As with all trucks the add ons and ""packages"" you have to buy for key features tend to drive up prices. If you have ever used the ford configurator online its massively confusing seemingly on purpose. I think based on the Mach-E they have some good engineering and they are putting their top brands out there as EV's. That takes some guts and is obviously great for the overall EV market. 

They are going to need to walk a fine line here. They need enough production to satisfy the demand, because invariably they will have moved some ICE buyers to EV buyers. The longer they make these people who have switched wait, the more at risk they are for losing revenue as they make the transition. This truck won't immediately cover all their customers needs but I think it would cover >%50. As always it comes back to batteries, if they can make/find them at a reasonable price this will be a smashing success and Ford will have cemented their company in the EV era. If they cannot they will have a big problem on their hands of their customers putting off buying till they can.

1stHandXp,"Hopefully Fork can keep up with production. I think they designed this truck just about as good as they could have. The home backup mode offers 9.6kW of backup power for your house - that’s such a nice bonus feature! And on the job site, 10 x 120V outlets and 1 x 240V 30A outlet. Plus the Frunk is well designed for easy loading. I think overall its a very good contender and hopefully will soak up a lot of ICE buyers and get more EV’s on the road. Tesla will have it beat on price, range and efficiency, but the design is polarizing and Ford has a huge following in the truck market already. Personally I would get a CT for the autopilot and supercharging, proven battery technology, and I love the looks of it. Tesla might also be able to ramp up production more quickly, but it’s hard to say!","<div class=""md""><p>Hopefully Fork can keep up with production.

SaddexProductions,"The Kodak of car manufacturers at it again, folks.

**Edit**: Adding some things. While Toyota is coming out with their first in-house developed BEV, the [bZ4X](https://global.toyota/en/newsroom/toyota/35083987.html), not only is it only at most a concept car to my knowledge with specs only discussed in abstract terms, it is per [carwow pretty pricey](https://www.carwow.co.uk/toyota/news/5266/toyota-bz4x-electric-car-revealed-price-specs-release-date);

> It’s likely it will be priced over £40,000 – a bit pricey for a Toyota. However, considering the carmaker plans to launch 15 all-electric models before 2025, you can bet cheaper alternatives will be along soon.

... but it is also the first fully electric vehicle from Toyota if you don't count the rebadged Citroën Jumpy (Toyota Proace). Like every other car manufacturer, it is probably not going to be perfect. Look at other automakers' first attempts and compare vs where they are now. Tesla started with the Roadster which was a quirky but expensive sports' car, then finetuned things with the Model S, 3, and so on. Volkswagen had the e-up (and Skoda Citigo) and the e-Golf, now we have MEB with ID.3, ID.4, Enyaq IV, Audi Q4 e-tron and so on. Audi had the regular e-tron, now we have the e-tron GT and soon the PPE platform will be out for both Audi and Porsche to use. Speaking about the latter, the Taycan was already a smash hit, and I doubt the electric Macan will disappoint either (built on the PPE of course). Mercedes had the EQC, EQA and EQV, none of them bad, but quite ""meh"" it terms of specs. The EQS is something else even if it looks quite weird. The range of 770 km WLTP is out of this world for a BEV.

And Hyundai and Kia should be entering their third generation of BEVs now? Their latest respective BEV products look quite formidable. Watch out for Chinese BEVs as well, especially BYD with their blade batteries who should be as formidable as if they were wielding real blades. That battery tech is [no joke](https://insideevs.com/news/495023/byd-blade-battery-entering-european-market/).

Point is that you can't really enter the market any longer and deliever something that doesn't leave a huge splash. That ship has pretty much sailed already. Even latercomers like Ford did pretty well IMO with the Mach-e and definitely the F150 Lightning (from what we have seen so far). If Toyota's entry really is that pricey, it really needs to deliever on tech, performance and range, and that might be a high bar even for a corporation of that size. But miracles have happened before.","<div class=""md""><p>The Kodak of car manufacturers at it again, folks.</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong>: Adding some things. While Toyota is coming out with their first in-house developed BEV, the <a href=""https://global.toyota/en/newsroom/toyota/35083987.html"">bZ4X</a>, not only is it only at most a concept car to my knowledge with specs only discussed in abstract terms, it is per <a href=""https://www.carwow.co.uk/toyota/news/5266/toyota-bz4x-electric-car-revealed-price-specs-release-date"">carwow pretty pricey</a>;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It’s likely it will be priced over £40,000 – a bit pricey for a Toyota. However, considering the carmaker plans to launch 15 all-electric models before 2025, you can bet cheaper alternatives will be along soon.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>... but it is also the first fully electric vehicle from Toyota if you don&#39;t count the rebadged Citroën Jumpy (Toyota Proace). Like every other car manufacturer, it is probably not going to be perfect. Look at other automakers&#39; first attempts and compare vs where they are now. Tesla started with the Roadster which was a quirky but expensive sports&#39; car, then finetuned things with the Model S, 3, and so on. Volkswagen had the e-up (and Skoda Citigo) and the e-Golf, now we have MEB with ID.3, ID.4, Enyaq IV, Audi Q4 e-tron and so on. Audi had the regular e-tron, now we have the e-tron GT and soon the PPE platform will be out for both Audi and Porsche to use. Speaking about the latter, the Taycan was already a smash hit, and I doubt the electric Macan will disappoint either (built on the PPE of course). Mercedes had the EQC, EQA and EQV, none of them bad, but quite &quot;meh&quot; it terms of specs. The EQS is something else even if it looks quite weird. The range of 770 km WLTP is out of this world for a BEV.</p>

<p>And Hyundai and Kia should be entering their third generation of BEVs now? Their latest respective BEV products look quite formidable. Watch out for Chinese BEVs as well, especially BYD with their blade batteries who should be as formidable as if they were wielding real blades. That battery tech is <a href=""https://insideevs.com/news/495023/byd-blade-battery-entering-european-market/"">no joke</a>.</p>

[deleted],"While we do need to cut our dependence on fossil fuels, we need to do so cautiously. Mining for lithium (while certainly not as bad as most things) can be extremely detrimental to local environments. Then the production of the batteries themselves is dangerous and the materials they are made of are detrimental to the environment if not recycled properly. Once the batteries are fully depleted only about 50% on average of the materials can be effectively recycled. Once recycling methods improve this will ultimately increase but at the rate we are going if may be too late. Most manufacturers now stating they will be fully electric by ~2030 is insanity. We really need a lithium alternative for that to be feasible. Electric is ultimately the way of the future but I do honestly believe that with enough R&D Hydrogen is a viable alternative as well.

If they dont which, face it, is far more likely as auto makers LOVE taking subsidies and adding to their bottom line, it becomes another tax on the taxpayer to pay for a rich man's car because MOST EVs are still unaffordable to the average joe. And so far, no maker is profitable on their EVs except Telsa so I hardly doubt they are going to rush to lower their prices.","<div class=""md""><blockquote>

Though, I&#39;d also never recommend one to someone who can&#39;t charge at home anyway, even without winter.</p>
