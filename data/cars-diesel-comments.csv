"It's exactly like this in Canada, I knew this would happen after the EPA crackdown. As a diesel mechanic everyone has ""a guy"" that remotes into your laptop and tunes the truck for you. It's been like this for over a decade in Canada with semi trucks, and there's diesel tuning shops for medium duty trucks absolutely everywhere. 

I'm also on a forum where people just openly sell cracked tuning software and OEM software or give it away for free. 

We saw a massive surge of deletes happening during covid because these emissions systems would fail, usually during a cold snap, then nobody could get parts to replace them. I heard of fleets having several trucks at a time that were down waiting for parts because of this. 5000 dollars to replace a DPF/SCR on a semi truck, or pay 2000 for a guy to do a delete remotely, then take an air hammer to the DPF and hollow it out. truck gets better mileage and is now more reliable.   
The other justification is on trucks that use PTOs to operate the hydraulics for a coiled tubing rig, or other oilfield stuff. If that DPF system fails and derates the engine, you can't pull out of the hole, or use your hydraulics in an emergency, it can literally get someone killed or cost millions of dollars.","<div class=""md""><p>It&#39;s exactly like this in Canada, I knew this would happen after the EPA crackdown.

"Smog in Salt Lake City, UT and surrounding areas is a serious problem. Over 50% of the smog in SLC (where I've lived for more than half a decade) is due to vehicle emissions. Performant cars are fun, but performance should not come at at the cost of producing one of of the worst types of pollution  (pm-2.5). Diesel vehicles are some of the worst offenders.

"For those in the EU:

SALT LAKE CITY — The Diesel Brothers reality TV stars must pay $848,000 for modifying, marketing and selling pickup trucks with emission control defeat devices installed, a judge has ruled.

U.S. District Judge Robert Shelby also issued a permanent injunction barring the Diesel Brothers from further violations, which he said stemmed from unlawful operations that still are economically enriching the defendants.

Those benefits continue, Shelby said in his ruling issued late Friday, “extending well beyond the profits from these prohibited activities to defendants’ status as television and social media celebrities, the reputation and notoriety of their brands, and the economic leverage they have used to accumulate assets and start new businesses.”

The ruling detailed about 400 violations in which the defendants bypassed systems designed to reduce emissions of particulate matter and nitrogen oxides from diesel vehicles.

Most of the $848,000 must be paid to the U.S. Treasury, according to Clean Air Act guidelines that allow citizens to file civil enforcement actions against polluters. But Shelby further ruled that $90,000 will go to the Davis County Tampered Diesel Truck Restoration Program.

The ruling is a victory for Utah Physicians for a Healthy Environment, which sued the Diesel Brothers after seeing modified trucks spewing black smoke on the Wood Cross-based truck enthusiasts’ Discovery Channel show, now in its sixth season.

“Illegally stripped down and modified diesel trucks have no place on our roadways,” Dr. Brian Moench, president of the doctors’ group, said Monday afternoon in a press release. “Any business that not only profits from doing that, but glorifies the plumes of pollution that their handiwork produces, should be held accountable, and that’s what this ruling does.”

Physicians’ attorney Reed Zars on Monday applauded the “lifetime ban” on further emissions violations. He also noted the judge’s ruling ordered that none of the $848,000 “can be avoided or charged in bankruptcy.”

Cole Cannon, the Diesel Brothers’ attorney, said it is too soon to know whether they will appeal the ruling.

“What’s disappointing is that the parties were unable to resolve this through a private settlement, which would have resulted in a lot more of a restorative effort in Utah,” Cannon said. “This order only has approximately 10% of the money staying in Utah. The other gets sent to Washington, D.C., and we all know how useful that’s going to be.”

In court documents leading up to the decision, the doctors’ group had sought more than $1 million in penalties and argued that the law allowed sanctions up to $4.4 million.

But Shelby gave the Diesel Brothers credit for various mitigating factors, such as that they earned only about $1,500 direct profit per truck of the 50 vehicles sold or given away in online sweepstakes during the five-year period addressed in the suit.

While David Sparks, owner of the defendant companies involved and the main star of the TV show, added a disclaimer on the program saying they did not support illegal truck modifications, the judge said the defendants overall “produced minimal evidence of good faith efforts” to comply with the law.

Shelby said the Diesel Brothers have not restored or offered to restore any of the tampered trucks they gave away in sweepstakes and that two trucks with defeat devices were sold even after the judge imposed a preliminary injunction.

The defendants can afford to pay the penalties, Shelby added, outlining in his ruling the assets of Sparks, know as “Heavy D” on the show, and his companies.

Sparks has become a celebrity with millions of social media followers and his income has “substantially increased” to an average of $300,000 annually in the last three years, the judge said.

Sparks received $482,597 in that period from Discovery Channel alone, according to the ruling.

The Sparks Motors truck dealership doubled its assets from 2016 to 2018 and at the end of that period had a helicopter and two planes.

Shelby largely discounted one key defense the Diesel Brothers offered regarding the magnitude of the penalties sought, that many of the defeat parts and trucks they sold ended up outside Utah.

“Defendants’ violations are no less serious simply because they exported their violations to other parts of the country,” Shelby wrote. “The violations were numerous, occurred over a long period of time, significantly increased the toxic pollutants emitted by diesel trucks, and pose a serious risk to human health. At bottom, the tampered trucks and the defeat parts continue to endanger human health, regardless of where they are.”

The judge said the doctors’ group demonstrated that the Diesel Brothers caused irreparable injury by increasing the amounts of toxic pollutants breathed by Northern Utah residents and that monetary damages can’t compensate for injuries suffered.

Seven Utah counties repeatedly have not met federal air pollution standards, especially on the Wasatch Front. The doctors’ groups says ozone and fine-particulate pollution emitted by diesel engines cause various health problems including cancer.

Sparks in the owner of Diesel Brothers affiliated companies including B&W Motors, doing business as Sparks Motors in Woods Cross, and Diesel Power Gear, the online merchandizing arm. Those entities also are defendants in the suit.

Other individual defendants are Diesel Brothers stars Joshua Stuart, “Redbeard”; and Keaton Hoskins, “The Muscle.”

Cannon said he was “shocked” that Shelby assessed $86,100 in penalties against Hoskins for selling two tampered trucks, only one of which he worked on.

“I think for a regular truck owner this would be pretty alarming to you,” he said.

Shelby also awarded litigation costs and attorneys’ fees to the doctors’ group, which will be determined in future hearings.

"US EPA did a report in 2020 on the number of tampered diesel pickup trucks, based on their own enforcement experience.

[EPA Report: Tampered Diesel Pickup Trucks: A Review of Aggregated Evidence from EPA Civil Enforcement Investigations](https://www.epa.gov/sites/default/files/2021-01/documents/epaaedletterreportontampereddieselpickups.pdf)

Based on this analysis, for cases it has investigated, EPA estimates that emissions controls have been removed from more than 550,000 diesel pickup trucks in the last decade. As a result of this tampering, more than 570,000 tons of excess oxides of nitrogen (NOx) and 5,000 tons of particulate matter (PM) will be emitted by these tampered trucks over the lifetime of the vehicles. __These tampered trucks constitute approximately 15 percent of the national population of diesel trucks that were originally certified with emissions controls.__ But, due to their severe excess NOx emissions, these trucks have an air quality impact equivalent to adding more than 9 million additional (compliant, non-tampered) diesel pickup trucks to our roads.","<div class=""md""><p>US EPA did a report in 2020 on the number of tampered diesel pickup trucks, based on their own enforcement experience.</p>

removing emissions stuff on a vehicle being illegal isnt the issue at all, its the fact that he decided to keep it as an off road use \*for fun\* vehicle and them still compelling him to put emissions equipment on the truck anyway. 

that is blatantly government over reach, idk how you could argue any different, this is this guys property that they explicitly tell him he is free to do with as he pleases and then turn around and threaten to destroy it if he doesnt return it to stock which completely defeats the purpose of entering it in a competition.

when the government comes to you and says you need to return your car to stock after youve done all kinds of modifications to it regardless of what it costs and if you dont they will literally destroy your property you dont just go ""ok, that sounds reasonable to me."" what the fuck are you people saying? fuck me. absolutely pathetic idiots.","<div class=""md""><p>idk why people are talking about this as if its not over reach.</p>

<p>when the government comes to you and says you need to return your car to stock after youve done all kinds of modifications to it regardless of what it costs and if you dont they will literally destroy your property you dont just go &quot;ok, that sounds reasonable to me.&quot; what the fuck are you people saying? fuck me. absolutely pathetic idiots.</p>

"As a diesel mechanic, I'm all for emissions equipment. And I don't even work in a shop where I make money based off those repairs (I maintain a fleet for a large organization). That being said, I do think the government needs to do something about the cost of this equipment. Regulate it, subsidize it or cover it. 

The emissions equipment on diesel equipment is expensive. Insanely expensive. For example, a Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF) for the trucks I maintain run north of $1800. EGR coolers run over $3k. Selective Catalyst Reduction units (used in DPF systems) can run upwards of $10k. On most systems built within the last 5+ years, when something on the system malfunctions, the ECU will de-rate engine power (sometimes making the vehicle completely useless) until the issue is fixed.
Joe Blow takes it to get fixed, is told the bill will be over $3k, he's probably going to seek out a way to get rid of that stuff so he won't ever have to deal with that issue again. However if the government would help cover that cost, I think you'd have people much more likely to comply with the regulations and equipment.

Obviously this isn't every case. Plenty of people out there who delete the stuff just to he diesel bros and would delete the stuff regardless.

<p>These tampered trucks constitute approximately 15 percent of the nationalpopulation of diesel trucks that were originally certified with emissions controls. But, due to their severe excess NOx emissions, these trucks have an air
quality impact equivalent to adding more than 9 million additional (compliant, non- tampered) diesel pickup trucks to our roads</p>

"Y’all are terribly informed about diesels. First of they produce no more nox emissions than a gas vehicle, they produce higher co2, which btw trees love co2

Talking about the “black smoke” being toxic is just untrue. Any particulate over 2.5 microns is consider not to be a health concern for people, which is the black smoke. Anything under 2.5 microns is considered a health concern and btw the dpf, nor the scr filters are able to filter below 2.5 microns. As far as toxic materials it’s been found that small amounts of vanadium are the reason for any health issues, which is from an incomplete combustion. Btw brakes create MUCH more toxic particulates than anything coming out of an exhaust, also clutch material is extremely toxic and found more frequently on electric vehicles. Tires produce more toxic particulate than exhaust emissions. 

So are we gonna ban brakes and tires and electric motors for emitting these toxic particulates? Stop making ignorant comments people. Do actual research on these issues, non biased research, your government is playing you because you’ll listen to them. An electric car is heavier creating more tire particulate, it’s power comes from fossil fuels, before it even gets to the showroom the process of making it produce more emissions than a gas vehicle does in 15 years, which the battery will be completely depleted by then and a gas car is 15 year will be producing less and less emissions than it did before. Don’t even get me started on the batteries themselves and how toxic they are.

Instead if being ignorant how bout we invest more in technology to make diesels run more efficiently. Ducted fuel injection is proving to be a great solution for diesels and can reduce particulate and from 50-100% only needing to control the nox emissions. 
How bout investing in creating brakes that emit less toxic materials? Nasa created an aluminum rotor that could completely get rid of the toxic particulates produced by creating a rotor surface that stays cool enough to not breakdown. 
How bout create a way to collect tire particulate while your driving so it’s not getting all over our roads, which is also something that could be recycled to make new tires. 
Oh and how bout we crack down on the road quality and start up keeping our roads nice and clean so were not constantly stirring up toxic particulates in the air. 

There are solutions to our issue people but this rush rush BS that every goes for needs to stop. Electric is NOT the future I can promise you that. If you really care about the environment you wouldn’t support this BS green movement in the US. Oh and how bout we crack down on china who produces twice if not more emissions that we produce.

"I have a 96 F150 XLT ext cab 4x4. 5.0 5spd, Manual T-Case and manual hubs. It came with AC, Power windows, locks and mirrors. BUT NOT A TACH? WTF FORD. (I put a factory one in).

Try and duplicate it now online  (Manual Trans and TCase---aside NLA) Try building one online and you end up at 40K and still have manual locks. WTF? add power locks that's $2K because its a package.

Pick the wrong color... it forces you to get the 2.7 Ecoboost add $2500

Want a little better radio...remove base package and add  TECHNOLOGY package 102A for $2200.

Thats what I like about my 96 vs say the 84 in the video. A little more modern with a few niceties, like a tach, power mirrors, locks and windows but without going over the top. Its comfortable enough to use day in and day out but its still a truck and does trucky things.

"US car makers will embrace it based on how this Cruze fairs in the marketplace.

One last thing... the Cruze diesel gets 46 MPG **HIGHWAY**.  I have yet to see its city mileage posted anywhere, while the Prius gets 51/48 - a *combined* 49.5 MPG.  Diesels will not do as well in city driving, meaning that the Prius will be cheaper to fill up and offer up better overall mileage.

If I did the same with gasoline I would have to go slower and it would eat twice as much fuel.

So teoreticky just try to calculate how much fuel(and enviroment) we would safe just on transporting if all cars used half the fuel as the diesels do. I work on tanker ship and we use 4000 to 5000 liters of fuel just to move cca 2mil liters of gasoline from holland to Germany. Plus then trucks have to move it from station to station and so on.

"A lot of people here think this is a result of people who just want big truck make smoke machine.  

I would wager that the majority of people who are altering diesel pickups are doing so to delete the DEF systems. The DEF systems in heavy duty trucks and equipment are notoriously problematic, to the point that the truck will go into limp mode or even shut down because the DEF system isn’t working.  

Up here in Alberta, a large amount of people will delete the DEF system even on brand new trucks, simply because they cause so many issues on an otherwise perfectly serviceable engine. On top of that, the DEF fluid freezes constantly in the harsh cold climate, which sends the truck into limp mode.   

I’ve even experienced DEF fluid freezing while driving on the highway in a Cummins diesel 5 ton Freightliner, it went into limp mode and I was limited to 30 km/h on the Alaska highway near Fort Nelson in the dead of winter. On top of that I had about 15000 lb of equipment on the flatbed and a 30000 lb trailer.

"Diesel owner here, this is a really interesting topic. 

Where a lot of this mess started was with people rolling coal, which made its way through social media, messing with Prius owners and bystanders. But the thing about rolling coal is that it is purely for show. Black smoke, “coal”, coming out your tail pipe directly reflects on the tuning of the vehicle. The achieve this, more fuel is dumped than required, resulting in unburnt carbon entering the atmosphere. This is TERRIBLE for your engine, diesel tuners know this. I’d like to believe it was a phase in the scene and that it is slowly washing out.

 You can still remove the emissions equipment from your Diesel engine and have no “rolling coal” effect. I’ve seen plenty of trucks that burn very clean with emissions equipment removed, because that is the ideal tuning for the vehicle. 

Another new thing is called “emissions intact tuning”. This is keeping all the emission equipment but still tuning the engine for performance/mpg/towing. Intact tuning can be done, and achieve the same performance as a “deleted” vehicle. 

My Chevy Colorado has the 2.8l Duramax engine in it, I have it with emissions intact tuning, and have gone from getting 20mpg on the highway to 30-33mpg. As well as globs of more torque. 

That said, emissions equipment is an absolute nightmare. One part is DEF, diesel exhaust fluid, which is injected into the exhaust tract in order to reduce nitrogen oxides amongst other things. But the thing with DEF is that it freezes. Even with the addition of DEF heaters etc, this is increasingly problematic especially in colder climates. I know individuals in Canada who immediately take their truck to have the emissions equipment removed because it’s simply too cold for it to properly operate. 

Now where the real gripe the diesel community has is, we have suffocated and essentially spoiled Diesel engines for the consumer market, yet big diesel ships have little to zero effort to reduce emissions. I’d go ahead and safely say that big ships contribute miles more pollution to our environment than small trucks do. 

It’s sad that this has happened due to Yeeyee boys, and likely we will never see the reversal as the emissions equipment is a global standard now. 

The Diesel engine had the opportunity to create a cleaner environment. Rudolph Diesel himself envisioned these engines running off of renewable fuel types. But with the addition of things like common rail fuel injection and emissions equipment in the name of cleaning up the pollutants, has restricted the engines from being able to support these fuel types.","<div class=""md""><p>Diesel owner here, this is a really interesting topic. </p>

"If the US bans all residential ICE vehicles tonight, it reduces global green house gas emissions by about .5-1.5% if its replaced by EV instantly

Auto transport in the world accounts for somewhere close to 15% of global emissions. Of that, America has around 20% of the amount of vehicles around the globe (***this doesn't take into account commercial ICE. Understand no matter how many EV trucks elon can show you, those are never going away.***). Thats 3% of emissions. Replacing them with EV doesn't fix the issue, it just shifts the emissions from 1 sector, the petrol industry, to lithium mining and refining in 3rd world nations who dont abide by environmental laws, and adds another thing, countless batteries, that need to be disposed of. Even if the US recouped emissions efficiently, at best it lessens emissions by half, to about 1.5%

And I am WAYYYY over estimating it for simplicity sake

The 10 guys rolling coal in your city doesn't do virtually any damage in comparison to any other common factor. Your Amazon addiction has a bigger factor on the global emissions issue that their truck. Their trucks are several orders of magnitude past a rounding error worth of significance 

You just dont like it because it's unsightly and it smells

Go ahead and insult their dicks, but your brain is smaller than their dick

A 12 year old kid has the understanding of fractions enough to figure out theyre ot the problem. The politicians complaining about this are equivalent to the 65 year old HOA rep complaining your garden gnomes ruin their property value and fine you 1000$","<div class=""md""><p>If the US bans all residential ICE vehicles tonight, it reduces global green house gas emissions by about .5-1.5% if its replaced by EV instantly</p>

"For one I believe the TDI comes better equipped than the base Sportwagen. The base TDI is comparable to the 2.5 SE, which is a difference of less than $2,000.

It's not just the higher torque, it's higher torque at such low RPM.

> Diesel models are more expensive than their regular gasoline counterparts. This led me to do some research.

Buy used, let someone else drop the premium down a significant amount.

TDIs are popular because the old ones are unbreakable if you do the maintenance and you can run them on bio diesel. They (new and old) also get above the rated MPG rather than gasoline which gets below the rated MPG. Not to mention 180k miles is just breaking in a Diesel engine, you can easily double that amount with regular maintenance. The gas engine is on it's last legs with that amount of milage. The new ones also can get something like 50mpg with a chip that not only inreases mpg but also raises HP and torque","<div class=""md""><blockquote>

"I would refrain from making your decision based on cost of fuel per mile.  I bought my 2K beetle TDI in 08.  At the time diesel was about 5¢ cheaper than 87 unleaded here.  I think that lasted for over a year.  The cost differential is variable.  You have to track it over time to see the changes.  

So if any part of your decision is based on the relative prices of the two fuels today, you might find your thought process undermined in a couple years.  It could improve, and it could actually get worse, no way to predict.  I drove round trip from TX to NY this year for less than $300 though.  That's pretty cool, and I did it in a 15 year old car.  There aren't too many 15 year old cars I'd try to make such a trip in and feel remotely confident. 

Most of the other reasons people cite are true in my experience.  It has amazing torque which allows you to cruise at very low RPM, but yet you can push the turbo all you want and drive it like you stole it and lose maybe 10% fuel efficiency.  My triple carburetor fun car will lose about 40% FE if driven hard.

It is by far the most reliable drive train I've ever owned.  VW has enough reliability issues in other areas.  Keeping them out of the drive train really helps.  For a couple hundred dollars you can get a VAG COM and diagnose problems as well as a pro.  The codes for the most part are actually meaningful. 

I suggest you drive one, and see if you even like it.  The really feel quite different from a gasser.  They aren't everyone's cup of tea quite honestly.  I may never sell mine.  When I get bored enough with it, I'll park it and keep it for long trips.

BTW, I paid $5500 in 08.  Because I'm a totally awesome owner and keep it in pristine condition I'm betting I could get about $3500, or higher for it today.  That's the lowest depreciation I've ever had in a used car.

<h1>4 People don&#39;t do the math like you&#39;ve done. The payback on diesels takes forever.</h1>

<p>I&#39;ve never owned a diesel but have probably driven them over 2,000 miles while in Europe. I didn&#39;t mind them but I didn&#39;t feel like they were any better than your standard petro powered car.  All three of them got around 45mpg while doing high speeds, which is nice. If you could get diesel cars in the U.S. for the same price as petro models and they made models I wanted, I would consider a diesel.</p>

"It depends on your usage profile really.

Fuel is more expensive for them.

There's actually a lot of stuff on them to break nowadays (modern common rail diesels are not the same as old school PD engines and the like).

They also deliver power in a certain way which you may or may not like.

Depending on your market, the purchase price is probably higher.

Here in Britain for less than 15k a year a diesel doesn't make financial sense even before you consider the additional stuff on them to break.

Since Euro 4 emissions standards, a lot of diesels have had what is called a ""Diesel Particulate Filter"". This is basically an extra bit of emissions kit that is suppose to burn up the sooty crap diesels cough up.

They need to get to up to a particular operating temperature to work though. If you do a lot of highway miles then you may be OK (actually, dunno how they do at 55mph). If you consistently don't, they break. On some engines, they are a service item anyway (2l Ford TDCIs). They're like a thousand quid.

Then there's the more specialised, more stressed fuel pump and injectors.

There's also the EGR valve.

Dual-mass flywheels (increasingly a feature on diesels).

The only people I know driving diesels who have had no problems with this stuff are driving really old school pre-euro 4 diesels and that brings it's own problems (turbos wear out for example). VW Pumpe Düse engines. Oldschool XUDT engines. Yeah, great engines in their day.

Modern CR engines? I think everyone I know who has one has problems with them. I work with a girl who's owned three VAG cars with various CR engines in and they've all had weird little faults. If I had to get one, it wouldn't be a VAG.

Then there's how the thing drives. Some people like the surge of torque low down the rev range. Personally though, I like revving an engine out and having linear precise throttle response. Especially on a dag dag, the turbo is a very noticeable mechanism between your foot and the wheels. Plus they sound terrible. Like a skeleton having a wank in a biscuit tin.

Now, conversely, if you do enough miles that the fuel economy compensates for the purchase price (it's a different sum here in Britain) and you're running the engine up and down a motorway (sorry, free-way) often enough to get the DPF hot then I'm sure it makes sense. They're not good for everything though.","<div class=""md""><p>It depends on your usage profile really.</p>

"Curious, in the west coast diesel is the same price as regular gasoline so that brings the equation more in diesels favor but still on the order of 125k miles to make up the price difference so from an economics standpoint yes it does not makesense.  The range however will be great, even if its a small 13 gallon tank that's a 546 mile range, I have a hunch the jetta wagon will do 600 miles to the tank freeway and that's pretty cool.  I drove one not too long ago and it feels like any other econo car but with some low end grunt sacrificing the top end.

That aside the reason I'm into diesels is the mechanics of the engine are historically very stout. Economically everyone has a hard on for electrics and hybrids but the battery tech is still costly and inefficient and damaging to the environment.  A diesel motor can be built without mining up toxic materials under dubious circumstances and shipping it around the world.  Diesel fuel can be grown.  As long as the planet is capable of supporting organic life we can keep diesels running and the newer ones are rather clean burning.  Electrics will not supplant ICE until there is an efficient way of transporting the fuel, until you can beat a fuel tanker or walking down the road with a 1 gallon fuel can and refuel in under a few minutes it won't catch on globally. Sure you can have widespread adoption in the first world where extra money can go into figuring out a support network but we are a miniscule population of drivers at this point.

All that aside as I'm still struggling with whether or not to go diesel while also worrying about VW reliability, I'm just praying that Mazda comes to their senses and brings us the 6 wagon with their diesel, unlikely due to how poor the 6 is selling but I can dream...

"Here is a long post I did on another forum comparing my hemi equipped Ram to the new Ecodiesel Ram. I know it's not cars (which are probably much closer in terms of savings), but it's interesting to look at:

So here is a breakdown...tried to be as rational as possible. This is based on an estimated 15,000 miles per year driven and searching prices online and rounding here and there for simplicity. I found an Ecodiesel owners manual...so capacities and intervals should be correct. 

* National avg. gasoline as of 6/9 = $3.674 

* I average about 15 mpgs combined city and hwy and have a 32 gal. tank. So my range is 480 miles. Assuming I drive 15,000 miles per year, I'd pump 32 gallons of gas 31.25 times per year. 

* 32 gal. x $3.674/gal. x 31.25 = $3,674.00 in gasoline per year 

* I change oil and filter every 5000 miles. 
7 qts full syn. + filter = $55.00 x 3 = $165.00 

* Air filter every 10,000 miles = $15.00 

So, I figure my 5.7l V8 costs me $3,854 per year. 




Now, most articles I've read on the ecodiesel have reported combined city/hwy mileage of 20-23, so I'll just use 21 mpgs. 

Assuming the same 32 gal. tank, the same 15,000 miles per year, and a 21 mpg avg you get a range of 672 miles. Which means I'd pump 32 gal. of diesel 22.32 times per year. 

* So, 32 gal. x $3.892/gal.(nat'l avg diesel) x 22.32 = $2779.82 in diesel per year. 

* Oil change interval for the 3.0 diesel says not to exceed 10,000 miles...I'll assume 7,500 mile interval just for simplicity. So two changes per year. 

* 10.5 qts full syn + filter = $145.00 x 2 = $290.00 

* 8 qts (2 gal.) DEF x $8.00/gal. = $16.00 x 2 = $32.00 

* Air filter every 10,000 miles = $30.00 

So an Ecodiesel will cost you approx. $3,131.82 per year. 

Now, it is definitely worth noting that most of my numbers are approximations based on searching parts on the internet...and obviously you don't fill a tank completely each time you fill up...so the fuel numbers are slightly exaggerated. But it still gives a decent idea as to how much it costs to run a big V8 vs. the smaller diesel. Despite the approximations and estimates, still pretty solid savings. I know there are some holes in my assumptions, so everyone feel free to point them out   

Solid savings, but probably still not quite enough to justify paying a $2000 - $3000 premium for the diesel. Just for fun though, I did go on Ram's website and built a 4x2 Laramie Longhorn Ecodiesel, fully loaded, MSRP came out to $54,000ish IIRC.","<div class=""md""><p>Here is a long post I did on another forum comparing my hemi equipped Ram to the new Ecodiesel Ram.

"Diesel is much better for the street. 

Diesel engines, especially turbodiesels, usually have lots of torque in the low rpm range, which in turn translates to quick accelerations at speeds of 0-50 mph or so. The downside is that they don't have a lot of horsepower, which means that if you are cruising at highway speeds, and you want to go even faster, a gas car will accelerate better. However, nobody who drives on the street really cares that much about being able to go from 70-100 as fast as possible.

On the plus side, you get much better mileage, so you don't have to worry about filling up as much. Diesel engines are also extremely reliable due to the fact that the block is overbuilt for the higher compression ratio, which means you can easily go many miles on them.

"My fiance has a 2011 TDI and I hated it at first.

I've grown to really like it. I'll try to talk about the TDI variant specifically. Things like sporty fun suspension would carry over across models.

1. It's very well equipped. I can't think of anything that would improve it base to make it more luxury other than heated leather seats and a sunroof.

2. It gets off the line like a rocket. I get yelled at when I shift at 3k. My damn motorcycle idles at that and I'm still getting 40+ MPG when I drive it like a prick.

3. I don't think it's fair to talk about money to break even. If you really wanted to save money by buying a new car you'd get at the MOST a 3 year old lease trade in. Buying new and eating all that value loss is a not a financial decision, it's an emotional one.

There are some issues we've had though

1. You can't fill it with anything other than Ultra Low Sulfur Diesel or B5 without voiding the warranty (except in IN). Some stations near us are starting to carry B20 and we are having to hunt for new stations so we don't void the warranty on the engine. Argue about the viability of it all you want, for us it's the warranty we're concerned about.

2. Seriously you have to wear gloves when you fill up, it's disgusting smelling. I use diesel to clean grime off engines I rebuild.

3. We hit a pot hole HARD at night and cracked the intercooler piping. The engine only realized something was wrong when we had a clogged particulate filter. Admittedly the car being low on power on initial acceleration led us to take it in, but the damage was done before we really noticed. Due to the amount of soot in the exhaust system the had to replace almost everything turbo back and a handful of other bits. I don't recall the exact part list but it was a $5000 repair on a car with 20k miles.","<div class=""md""><p>My fiance has a 2011 TDI and I hated it at first.</p>

"Great question. I recently went from my love, an 05 Impreza where I averaged 27 mpg per tank over 350 miles. 

I now drive a 2012 Jetta TDI and average 38 mpg (on a bad day) over 600 miles. 

Firstly, the govt MPG ratings are consistently way lower than actual achieved averages. I have only ever averaged as low as 40mpg on a whole tank and 38mpg on a trip more than 5 miles.

A prime example, with the Jetta, I just drove 641 miles and averaged 50.2 mpg. 

Let's break down the costs:

Subaru - 3.70$/27 mpg = $.137 per mile

Avg Jetta - 3.96$ (Sam's Club price)/38 mpg = $.104 per mile

Road trip, highway Jetta - 3.96$/50.2 mpg = $.078 per gallon.

Additionally, newer diesels, especially VWs have longer times between services; 10k between oil changes, no spark plugs, 120k on timing belts.

I honestly expected to see a much higher number of miles traveled per day.  But of those averages are accurate, EVs would make a great Taxi.

"at least where I'm from, taxi's rarely stop operating, so I'm wondering how this is going to work.

We're one of many countries/regions that issue taxi plates.  They're expensive to buy, expensive to renew/maintain..... the whole 9 yards.  Because of this, it's not feasible for one person to earn enough to pay for all the expenses related to taxi operation, by themselves, so they lease out their cab to others while they go home and spend time with the family/friends/sleeping/whatever.  Which means the plate gets more use and since it's bolted to a car, the car is still in use.  still driving, still taking fares, still doing all the things a taxi does.  This means that for more than a few taxis (dare I say, the majority of them), there's usually less than a few hours of down-time throughout the day (where they're not being employed to earn money for someone).

So I'm curious, with taxi vehicles, constantly on the move, how do you find 3-4 hours in the day, to charge it up all the time, and keep it charged incase you get a long-haul fare (eg. driving to the next town over, or something)?

It seems good in concept, but in practice, you'd need quite a few more taxi plates floating around to make up the difference in coverage, IMO.  this is something that most regions seem to be very hesitant on.  Hybrids are a good fit for this use-case, since they can stop and power down for a while, or drive around for good portions of time on electric only, but are able to generate their own power when needed via gasoline, either through a full engine or a gas range extender on-board.  Though this complicates the mechanism and can increase maintenance requirements and down-time overall.

There's a much larger discussion to this than what's on the surface. yay electric taxis, but how will that look moving forward?","<div class=""md""><p>at least where I&#39;m from, taxi&#39;s rarely stop operating, so I&#39;m wondering how this is going to work.</p>

<p>We&#39;re one of many countries/regions that issue taxi plates.  They&#39;re expensive to buy, expensive to renew/maintain..... the whole 9 yards.  Because of this, it&#39;s not feasible for one person to earn enough to pay for all the expenses related to taxi operation, by themselves, so they lease out their cab to others while they go home and spend time with the family/friends/sleeping/whatever.  Which means the plate gets more use and since it&#39;s bolted to a car, the car is still in use.  still driving, still taking fares, still doing all the things a taxi does.  This means that for more than a few taxis (dare I say, the majority of them), there&#39;s usually less than a few hours of down-time throughout the day (where they&#39;re not being employed to earn money for someone).</p>

<p>So I&#39;m curious, with taxi vehicles, constantly on the move, how do you find 3-4 hours in the day, to charge it up all the time, and keep it charged incase you get a long-haul fare (eg. driving to the next town over, or something)?</p>

<p>It seems good in concept, but in practice, you&#39;d need quite a few more taxi plates floating around to make up the difference in coverage, IMO.  this is something that most regions seem to be very hesitant on.  Hybrids are a good fit for this use-case, since they can stop and power down for a while, or drive around for good portions of time on electric only, but are able to generate their own power when needed via gasoline, either through a full engine or a gas range extender on-board.  Though this complicates the mechanism and can increase maintenance requirements and down-time overall.</p>

<p>There&#39;s a much larger discussion to this than what&#39;s on the surface. yay electric taxis, but how will that look moving forward?</p>

"This is insane. My first vehicle was an XL-trim single cab F150, which I bought new in 2005 (first year of new body style to boot) for $17k all in. Of course it is not an apples-to-apples comparison, but I’m in complete shock that a similarly equipped, crew cab truck stickers for $38k+. I checked into a base single cab f150 and found the sticker of $28,700 with the base gasoline V6. 

How can a domestic manufacturer get away with a pricing increase of ~75% in just over a decade?","<div class=""md""><p>This is insane.

"My X5 diesel, which is utilizing a six-speed auto and AWD, can get 30 MPG without trying too hard.  And that's technology from ten years ago, at least.  Towing 6000 pounds and it can still get low-20's without stressing too much.  All highway driving.  

Good for Ford for bringing this truck to market.  But I think diesel is not going to recover to the level it once was at.

*Edit, OK I got a little carried-away here.  On my last car-hauling trip, which was 90% highway driving at 60 MPH, I got 20.3 MPG over the duration of the trip.  That was open highway, driving with light traffic and its Texas so it's flat for the most part.  I stand by my statement of low 20 MPG's.

"I really like the inline 6 as a diesel, but it's still only about 1/2 of the numbers the 2018 Ford Powerstroke 6.7 (a $9500 option) is making:

"Im a diesel engine performance engineer, so let me lay this out for you as best I can

The principle benefit of Diesel over gasoline, is twofold:

Lower maintenance and better efficiency.

This comes at a fairly significant upfront cost.  For heavy duty trucks, and off highway machinery, trains, generators etc... this is a totally worthwhile trade off.  Pay a little more upfront and reap the benefits for decades.  Heavy duty trucks for example will often complete a million miles in their life.  

This trade-off is obviously improved in favor of diesel if the price of the diesel fuel is lower, as it is in Europe due to differences in taxes. In the US where taxes are very low the ""subsidy"" for diesels doesnt exist so the trade-off only really works in favor of diesels if you plan to really put a ton of miles on the car.

So lets look at why Europe and the US are so different:

Emissions and a bit of world history

Emissions come in lots of forms:  

* Greenhouse gases
* Hydrocarbons (called HC)
* NOx (oxides of nitrogen)
* Particulate matter (we call PM)
* Other hazardous compounds (CO, Sulphur dioxide, formaldehyde etc...)

In the US, following World war II (which was primarily won based on the availability of oil to the belligerent nations) - there was little to no tax or limitations on fuels.  After all Texas and the US was the worlds largest oil producer.  Europe on the other hand was in the process of shedding its colonial territories and had little of its own production.  In post war Europe then gasoline rationing continued for years and following that gasoline was treated like a luxury item and taxed heavily.  In the US muscle cars and large sedans boomed in the 1960s with 5, 6 or 7 liter V8 engines and often single digit gas mileage.  In Europe at the same time most cars had miserly 1 to 2 liter engines. There was a tax in Europe to diesel too, but for businesses that tax might be waved (bus companies, farms etc..) and the fuel tax was similar to the gasoline tax.  If both gasoline and diesel cost the equivalent of $6/gallon, fuel efficiency of diesels really start to add up even if the initial cost is higher.  In the US both gasoline and diesel were very cheap, so the additional cost of a diesel in a passenger car never really made sense and customers wanted performance more than efficiency something diesel could not deliver.

By the mid to late 1960s Americans noticed thick choking smog over major cities, especially California cities that had lots of sunlight and mountain ranges to the east.  European cities like London had their own emissions problems but were mostly caused by coal burning not cars.   California (California air research board - CARB) and eventually the EPA recognized that HC, NOx and PM created smog (look up photochemical smog - the sunlight plays a role turning some emissions into Ozone).  

The US therefore started to lead the world in emissions reduction in cars.  The process started out poorly with little in the way of innovation.  To meet the new regulations manufacturers lowered compression ratios, added ""smog pumps"" to engines to inject air into the exhaust to try to minimize HC and tried to minimize valve overlap to reduce emissions at idle.  This lead to the end of the muscle car era at the same time that the Arab oil embargo happened.  It was a bad time for US automakers.  Eventually though they innovated and through the use of 3 way catalysts and the precise fuel injection needed to make that work - they prevailed and engines could once again make more horsepower.  Unleaded fuel was needed to prevent the ""poisoning"" of the catalyst and so the switch was made to unleaded fuels for this reason.  In Europe catalysts, fuel injection and unleaded fuels would take another decade to arrive.  You could still buy leaded gasoline until the year 2000 in the UK.

So what about diesels?  Well during the late 20th century - diesels had no catalyst options and were far worse polluters than these newer gasoline engines.  (worse in PM and NOx, but actually slightly better in greenhouse gases) Therefore the EPAs rules tended to limit them to heavy duty uses like trucks and buses.  The fuel savings wasn't good enough for customers to demand the kind of expensive technology that could reduce the emissions on a diesel engine.  Yes certain attempts by general motors to make diesel engines out of gasoline engines made their reputation worse - but also highlight the difference in engine technology.  Diesels by their nature (high compression ratios, low RPM/high torque) need to be built differently of higher strength materials to fully realize their fuel consumption and low maintenance advantage.  Cutting corners ends with an unreliable engine.

In Europe however ""smog"" wasnt as big a problem - there is also less sunlight to work on the chemicals. As mentioned the public had high taxes on fuel to deal with and diesel for passenger cars was more attractive.  Despite lower horsepower (and no the torque does NOT make up for that - Torque is easy to make with a final drive ratio - you cant ""make up"" for horsepower) customers enjoyed the better fuel consumption that diesels offered, choosing to pay more up front to reap that benefit.

Eventually of course smog started to catch up with European cities and at the same time the EPA started to mandate improvements in the US even for the heavy duty engines.  This lead to a series of enhancements for diesel engines - similar to the 1980s for gasoline, but 20 years later.  particulate traps, EGR, SCR catalysts and oxidation catalysts all can be employed to reduce NOx, HC and PM.  

To complicate matters European countries saw the problem with climate change and started to create laws that incentivized lower CO2 emissions from cars.  Lower CO2 per mile is basically the same as lower gas mileage and so Diesels do well at this.  So in Europe carmakers set about designing diesel engines with the new technology: EGR, catalysts, new fuel systems to better atomize the fuel, and particulate traps.  

Why dont we get those in the US?  well the VW cheating scandal did of course have an effect but it highlighted part of the problem:

Those technologies cost money.  VW was trying to produce a car that got better fuel mileage, cost less up front and made more power than the competition.  To do this they cheated and essentially left off some of the technology that other companies employed to meet emissions - instead they insisted they could meet the emissions without ALL these devices.  This lead to better fuel economy and power and lower cost.  It was of course bullshit and they got found out.  But it points out how while yes, it is POSSIBLE to make a car with a diesel engine as clean as a modern gasoline engine, it does lead to trade-offs in performance, purchase price and also the fuel efficiency.  Once those things are considered - to the US market where gasoline is very cheap (compared to Europe) and Diesel is slightly more expensive - Diesel doesnt make financial sense for a car whose life is going to be somewhere around 150 to 250,000 miles.  It becomes a wash, where the initial price and slightly lower fuel consumption balance out.  Maintenance is complicated by the additional technology needed to limit emissions and the performance is reduced compared to gasoline engines. 

In the US Diesel works in heavy duty applications, trucks, buses and off highway equipment.  Full size heavy duty pickup trucks have employed them although you really need to do a lot of miles towing and hauling to make it worthwhile.  Passenger cars though, rarely see the full benefit in their predicted lifespan. 

If youre still stuck on ""WHAT ABOUT ALL THE TORQUES!"" that diesel offers.  I offer you this counter argument.  With a big enough lever I can move the world.  I can make 1000 ft.lbs of torque on a bicycle - if I employ a deep enough gear reduction.  Of course it will be agonizingly slow.  Thats because horsepower is Torque X speed (or RPM in this case).  Torque is only ever half the equation when it comes to doing work and doing it fast.  Diesels have torque yes but they dont have the RPM and the power.  This suits heavy duty applications just fine but the fact is a diesel is not a high performance engine.  Trying to make it into one requires massive increases in cost, and immense cylinder pressures and temperature which eventually result in much lower service life.  That may be fine for a drag racer who has money to burn but isnt much good when it comes to producing high performance passenger cars for the mass market.  Sure there are guys making over 1000hp in their pick up trucks, but it cost a fortune to get there - doesnt meet emissions laws anymore (and more to point creates massive pollution) and if driven hard will not last long - see tractor pulling and dyno videos for all the ways diesels can and do fail spectacularly.","<div class=""md""><p>Im a diesel engine performance engineer, so let me lay this out for you as best I can</p>

<p>The principle benefit of Diesel over gasoline, is twofold:</p>

<p>Lower maintenance and better efficiency.</p>

<p>This comes at a fairly significant upfront cost.  For heavy duty trucks, and off highway machinery, trains, generators etc... this is a totally worthwhile trade off.

"Several reasons.  Poor US diesel quality in the US that does a poor job keeping fuel pumps lubricated.  This can cause pump failure and very high repair costs.  (Upwards of 8k on a typical VW as the entire fuel system will need repairing).  You can offset this by using fuel additives, but it's kind of a pain to do.

DPF (for particulates and emissions) failure.  On a typical VW this costs 2k+ to replace.  Ideally you should be able to just refurbish the DPF, but they often aren't designed that way and you have to replace both the DPF and a section of the exhaust.

If you live in a cold climate diesels don't warm up by idling.  You have to drive them to get them to warm up.  This is manageable but less than ideal.

Also, you have to be sure you find a place with good fuel (higher the cetaine the better - but distributors don't post what that is for diesel) especially in the winter to avoid gelling.  Which untreated diesel can do in below freezing temps.  Distributors put in anti gel in fuel which is basically kerosene from what I understand.  This reduces the already lousy cetane level of US diesel which will reduce fuel mileage.  Again this can be offset with fuel additives.

Also hindering demand for diesel was Volkswagen&#39;s own crisis, now nearly a decade old, that also affected brands such as Audi, Skoda, and SEAT.</p>

<p>Still, it&#39;s too early to completely write off diesel models in Europe.</p>

Then there's higher service & fuel cost... Diesel vehicles require MORE maintenance when compared to Heavy-Duty Gas engines.  You could argue that they even out when considering fuel economy but Diesel costs more per gallon  (In the U.S.) and the Diesel variant probably gets about 2-3 MPG better, you may actually save money using the gas engine here if it meets the towing and payload requirements for what you need.

"Check out what's behind Joel Beltramo--the F-450 regular cab 4x2 that Ford introduced last year for the 2019 MY to try and take the crown back from Ram with 35,000 lbs. max towing. It worked for about 4 months before Ram put out their 35,100 lbs. tow monster. And now it'll just be a footnote in the annals of automotive history.

But to actually stay on-topic, this 7.3 is neat. I've had nothing but good experiences with the 6.8 V10 in our farm truck (the transmission is another matter), with the exception of lousy MPG. I know, I know, you shouldn't care about that in a one-ton, but single-digits is hard to live with. From asking around, it's clear that the 6.2 is a better engine for unloaded use, with better MPG, but it's a drop in torque vs. the old V10, and that matters more for our application. If this 7.3 has the same low- to mid-teens MPG of the 6.2 with higher torque, Ford has our interest. And I predict we'll see yokels swapping this into their Raptors before long (never mind how much heavier this may be over a 3.5 EB).

"I'm going to guess 450hp and 500lb-ft. Dodge puts out 410hp with their 6.4L and Ford obviously wants to beat them. Fords 6.2L is 385hp so thats 62hp/L out of SOHC 2V. I would imagine this would have similar hp/L. 

I'm seriously going to follow this engine closely. My shop services a fleet of 6.8L V10 Ford engines and I can't stand working on them. They feel gutless and are a bit of a pain to work on. 

I'm curious about compression ratio, rotating assembly (Forged or cast), and cylinder liners. I really doubt they would use their plasma arc coating, they have to keep the engines rebuildable for customers who have highly custom commercial vehicles that can't easily be replaced.

"You're getting answers about efficiency, cost etc and they are all correct.

But one should also keep in mind that a vast majority of drivers out there never really rev their (petrol) cars above 4000 RPM. I.e. they always drive in the RPM range where diesels are much more powerful than petrols of similar size.

So to most people who drive cars, a 150 hp diesel will feel significantly faster (in terms of acceleration) than a 200 hp petrol. Because they never use the 200 hp peak power at 6000 RPM of the petrol engine. But the diesel might have peak power at 3500 RPM, and so they might actually use all that power in the diesel.

<p>Getting a million miles out of a diesel is standard life span without needing a rebuild..  Getting a million miles out of a gas fueled engine is quite a feet.</p>

Most of the answers here miss a crucial detail, it's businesses worrying about fuel costs and not individuals.

90% of these are professionally driven, the rest are probably rental cars.

Hotels, taxi companies, security companies and Uber drivers like the small diesel engines.

That said, when buying a new car where I live, some companies here now have phased out diesels, spec them very poorly to discourage purchases, and even tax them highly such that diesels cost significantly more. As purchase price increases for a car, the tax scales up for diesels where hybrid or PHEV powertrains end up much cheaper, which is pretty clever.

"In the US diesel has a lot going against it. Diesel costs more at the pump, diesel engines cost more to buy in the first place, diesel has maintenance intensive/high failure rate emissions equipment, and diesels aren't typically offered on commuter oriented vehicles. 

In the US there's an industry called hotshotting which is where heavy duty trucks take loads that are either expedited, on the small side for a semi truck, or moving a small number of cars for dealers or for customers that are moving. Most of these drivers own their trucks. 

A lot of them that do smaller loads are going to gas motors since breakdowns are less common and the fuel economy savings don't balance out the breakdown times/cost.  Also gas motors have a lot better longevity in the last 10-20 years while diesels have had more systems added to them which reduce fuel economy (but decrease emissions) and create more opportunities for the truck to go into limp mode.

The other thing is hotshot trucks are commerical trucks so they can't remove their emissions gear like many private owners do. ""Deleting"" which is the process of removing diesel emissions equipment is super common in the US as most states don't require emissions testing for diesels and the owners want more performance, fuel economy, and longevity. It's highly illegal for private owners to delete their trucks too, but there's a very small chance of getting caught outside of California.

In commuter cars the only very common diesel in recent history was VW's TDI. The reputation of commuter diesels were heavily tarnished by their emissions scandal.

FCA also had a scandal and the ""fix"" which changed the ECU programming on ecodiesels made them drive like crap. Most people either didn't get the reprogram, sold theirs soon after, or used aftermarket tuning (illegal) to get back to pre-fix drivability. The ecodiesels also have a reputation for catching on fire. 

I owned a pre emissions diesel and loved it. But, I'd have a lot of trouble justifying the purchase of a post emissions diesel given the cost of diesel, the initial cost, and the cost to keep them running.","<div class=""md""><p>In the US diesel has a lot going against it.

"I did the math for a diesel the last time I was looking to buy, and just couldn't make it work. A non-mechanical diesel will destroy any ROI with one cab-off injector replacement, even if I deleted the EGR/DPF.

Sure, if I could find a pristine 7.3, I might make it work per-mile, but those were too old at the time I was looking, I really wanted to stay at five years old or newer. And since I don't tow anything bigger than a 6x10 utility trailer, that wasn't a driving factor either. The nail in the coffin was the lack of waste veggie oil being a viable market anymore, restaurant owners know they're sitting on gold now.

"It became a thing in the EU to keep cost of living down

EU overtax and overregulation to keep CO2 emissions down.

Diesel vehicles get better mpg and cause less CO2 emissions than gasoline when burned.

So as an ordinary consumer if you want to keep the amount of vehicle tax you pay each year to a minimum, you have a choice of a small car with a straight-3 gasoline engine, or a full/normal sized sedan/suv with a straight-4 diesel engine, as they will tend to emit the same amount of CO2 which means the same of tax, so why go for the small borderline-lawnmower style engine gasoline car? The diesel car also gets better mpg.

Any business which keeps a car fleet for its employees is taxed on the emissions of their fleet, so again the choice is a small gasoline car or an executive diesel sedan, thats a no brainer, your employees get to keep using the regular executive vehicle while also paying minimal tax and also getting better mpg than any gasoline vehicle could muster.

So now car companies selling in Europe naturally cater to this and so then you had an explosion in diesel uptake, for a decade diesel suddenly achieved parity, and then started to outsell gasoline vehicles.

This didnt happen in the US because:

- Diesels emit other harmful substances too in huge amounts, in the US those are heavily penalized to disincentivize diesel use, just go to a city in Europe and a city in the US - big difference in air quality, in Europe they just overlooked this and stuck to mainly caring about CO2 emissions.

- It is difficult to bring gasoline usage down, the country would be burned down by now if the US tried to emulate some of the anti-C02 regulations and taxes including the absurdly high gasoline taxes in Europe.

- It is not particularly necessary to bring gasoline usage down from a practical view, the US is the still the biggest oil producer today let alone for all of history, crude is plentiful, whereas in Europe they do not have much of it.","<div class=""md""><p>It became a thing in the EU to keep cost of living down</p>

My first car was a 1980 Oldsmobile Cutlass diesel. We swapped in a 305 gas engine and it ran awesome. The front fenders and hood were made from aluminum to reduce weight to help compensate for the heavier diesel engine. Loved that car. I shortened it by about a foot one day when somone failed to yield to me at a unmarked crossing in the middle of Kansas. T-boned them doing about 65. Walked away from it with 12 stitches.,"<div class=""md""><p>My first car was a 1980 Oldsmobile Cutlass diesel. We swapped in a 305 gas engine and it ran awesome.

"A ""tuned"" Supra runs a 14.1 in Houston with excellent DA?!  Not impressive at all.

Then in the Viper video, the ""supercharged"" Viper runs an 11.80... which is a extremely slow time for being a supercharged Viper.  A good driver with DR's in a stock 2003+ (Gen 3) Viper can beat that.

Let's look at this objectively: The 11.44 pass is impressive for a truck, but the ""competitors"" are hand picked losers for their respective rides, and the truck driver has dumped 10's of K in performance mods into his ride...","<div class=""md""><p>A &quot;tuned&quot; Supra runs a 14.1 in Houston with excellent DA?!

"In 'merica, while diesels go further per unit of fuel the higher price of diesel makes it so the extra distance is partially made up for in extra fuel cost.

In Germany and France, diesel is slightly cheaper than gasoline 8% and 3% respectively.

"Not a diesel owner, but I understand the want for it in many cases.

However, with modern gasoline engines, it getting harder to make arguments for diesel fuel.

To create an example, I recently had a rental car 2016 VW Passat. For all intents and purposes there is no TDI version of this car in the US now, but the most recent iteration of it would have been able to average according to its owners on Fuelly.com; about 40 MPG.

In the 3000 miles that I did with my Passat TSI (1.8T) I was able to average 38 MPG, and honestly a lot of it was hard driving, it was a rental after all. On a single road trip with the cruise control set about 90% of the time, I was able to break 42 MPG. This was on 87 octane fuel at about $1.80 a gallon. 

One can now argue; why would someone buy a more expensive version of the Passat with a Diesel engine, that gets similar average MPG, has less horsepower, and has higher costs for fuel?

Diesel used to be a huge fuel economy increase, before more recent emissions regulations it wasn't unheard of to get 50 US MPG in a diesel on a road trip, and some of the more modern smaller VW diesels still can find this number with careful driving. But at the end of the day, the extra costs are now no longer warranting the benefits. 

That said, Diesel engines are great for every day traffic, especially in cities. Low end instant torque means V8 throttle response out of smaller turbocharged 4 cylinder engines.

I get why people like them, but unfortunately they really don't fit so well in today's world anymore; not unless someone figures out how to get those fuel economy figures higher. 

I think we will still find a demand from some of the people who still prefer the way the engines drive, but at that point it won't be for fuel economy benefits, its already proven that the lower cost gasoline engines with similar fuel economy figures offer better benefits over their diesel cousins.

"I've experienced a runaway diesel on the highway before - pretty scary stuff. It was a 1980 VW Dasher Diesel. OK, with 55HP, it was mildly unsettling.

They had a quirk where they could start siphoning oil through the PCV system into the intake and running on that after a period of sustained high speed operation, which, with 55HP and only a 4-speed, was anything north of 65MPH. Killing the switch cut off the fuel supply but the feed of oil was sufficient to keep it running like it'd been equipped with an afterburner. The only way to stop it was to pull over, stand on the brakes and dump the clutch in 4th gear and hope to stall it. Or, you could wait for the engine to suck the oil dry and seize and/or overrev and explode (like above) and/or catch on fire (like above) but those option were more expensive and detrimental to your journey. 

As long as you stayed at or below 65MPH, everything was fine though and as soon as you collected your breath you could get on your way again.","<div class=""md""><p>I&#39;ve experienced a runaway diesel on the highway before - pretty scary stuff.

"I'm from Canada, which has similar emissions regulations with the US. I always lamented how we didn't get the cool cars from the European and Japanese domestic market, like the Hilux Diesel, diesel BMW and Audi wagons with manuals (shut up, the CTS-V Wagon just doesn't do it for me), the F20 M135i, Scirocco R, the X5 M50d and M550d, Skyline GT-R, EP Civic Type R, Mk1 and Mk2 Focus RS, DC5 Integra Type R, Renaults, Peugeots, Lancias, Alfa Romeos, the list goes on and on and on.

However, after doing some research, it turns out that the EU plays really fast and loose with emissions testing, and I wrote a post explaining my findings: https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/3lkpxq/consumer_reports_strips_recommended_rating_from/cv7lncl

With that being said. NOx and particulates contributing to smog seems to only be a California thing; it's not like the rest of the country, or Canada, would have the same smog issues if cars with higher levels of NOx were on the road. So, why does the rest of the continent have to play by California's rules, meaning I have to pay $46K if I want a Focus RS, while Mexico sticks with EU regulations and [gets the Mk2](http://i.ytimg.com/vi/lASmJ4ouLg4/maxresdefault.jpg)? 

Diesels faltered in America after GM churned out crappy Oldsmobile diesels in the 70s and 80s. Nowadays, with the Ram 1500 EcoDiesel and Grand Cherokee EcoDiesel, and the Chevy Colorado/GMC Canyon with the new Duramax Diesel 2.7L inline-4, proving that the Detroit Big Three can make a decent diesel car (I'm neglecting the Cruze Diesel because it only comes with leather and auto transmission, and is $3,000 more expensive than the base Jetta TDI), will the American opinion sour on diesels once again?

"What pollutes is vaporizing fossil fuels into the air.    Right now the world is vaporizing 90 MILLION barrels of oil a day into the air.    More or less efficient vaporization affects the pollution,   but the total volume of matter vaporized is the prime mover of carbon dioxide emissions and other components of combustion that are added to the atmosphere.

So,  VW comes along and their diesels vaporize less fossil fuel into the air than most cars.    A car can pass emissions and still vaporize a gallon every 10 miles,   four times as much as the VW!

You can't even smell or see the diesel smoke coming out of a VW.

And the catalytic converter in gas cars is a mixed blessing.    Catalytic converters substantially increase toxic emissions for the first 15 minutes from a cold start until they reach 430°C (806°F).   More negative facts follow.

In other words,   the regulatory environment is fucked.   Gas taxes fund roads and are based on gallons sold,  so perverse incentives continue to encourage over all consumption (gallons sold) with global consequences.

Fuel mileage per vehicle in the US has  been subsequently lower than anywhere else in the world.

History will be the judge.

In the meantime,   VW has apparently engaged in deliberate fraud.    Lets not forget the underlying virtually corrupt regulatory system is bound to have factored into the rationalizations for this fraud.

"The fuel economy argument has been steadily losing steam because of the increasing amount of extra maintenance diesels require nowadays - i.e. what you save in fuel costs over a petrol car, you pay back in DEF/DPF/maintenance.  At some point, we will also see diesel performance start to plateau as manufacturers run out of ways to keep emissions down and resort to detuning the engine (it's already happening in bigger diesels).  However, HEVs and BEVs remain relatively unproven in the truck market, and science doesn't exactly support them being able to replace a diesel there.  EVs largely get their current range numbers from being efficient rather than energy-dense, but you can't cheat the energy requirements of towing/hauling, so the usual economies of EVs just aren't there, at least not in any sufficient amount to offset the capability penalty such drivetrains impose.

In the consumer car market, I think diesel is probably dead, if only because the EPA will be scrutinizing anyone who attempts it **very** closely after Dieselgate (and Daimler being caught doing the same thing back in Germany).  But diesels still have a pretty bright future in pickup trucks, and maybe even room to grow - for example, it's worth pointing out the Colorado is the only midsize pickup that offers a diesel right now, despite the segment having over half a dozen participants.

"In Southern California, there's this new fuel called Renewable Diesel (R99 at the pump) that's basically what you're talking about, and it's already really great. It uses the same feedstock as biodiesel (so no more oil drilling), but it's processed in the same way regular diesel is as to be chemically compatible. It's a purer substance that burns cleaner than regular diesel and reduces emissions. The majority of the pumps around here provide it. I use it in my TDI daily, and I love it. I've definitely noticed a reduced smell and smoother operation in my vehicle. For the diesels I drive with DPFs, I notice a longer DPF regen interval because the car is producing less soot.

https://afdc.energy.gov/fuels/renewable_diesel.html

Note: it's NOT the same thing as biodiesel. Biodiesel sucks anyways because concentrations larger than B5, B10 can cause issues with oil dilution, as biodiesel can slip down the cylinder walls when the car is injecting extra fuel to light off the DPF, at the end of the stroke. Renewable Diesel, being produced through a slightly different process, doesn't have this issue.","<div class=""md""><p>In Southern California, there&#39;s this new fuel called Renewable Diesel (R99 at the pump) that&#39;s basically what you&#39;re talking about, and it&#39;s already really great.

"It's always interesting to read threads like this. There are many opinions out there based on other opinions rather than facts.

E30 is relatively popular with tuners running fuel-injected forced induction engines. It hits a sweet spot with 30% ethanol raising the octane to the Premium level. The per-gallon cost savings over conventional premium fuel are considerable. If a car is E15-authorized from the factory, switching to E30 isn't a horrid thing from a mechanical standpoint.

E85 isn't the way to go for most street-driven cars. Too many negatives. But if you're running a crazy-tuned motor, it's awesome. Ask the pros in Formula Drift what they run in their cars. It's ethanol. I surveyed the drivers a few years back -- it was nearly the entire field. Cheap, high-octane racing fuel is wonderful when you're running on a tight budget.

The thing that most folks miss about ethanol is that each and every American has the government-given right to distill their own. If you have a source of cheap sugar, you can make hooch to run in your own vehicles, kinda like solar, in that respect.

While diesel models have also been more expensive than their gasoline equivalents, their efficiency and (some crappy engine designs aside) longer life compared to gas engines made disels a better economic choice if the buyer was going to put lots of miles on the car. 

Another element no one has touched on is that diesels became popular partially because they emitted less of the pollutants that contributed to greenhouse gases than gas engines did. Between that and the efficiency, many governments taxed diesels favorably over gas engines. But as people discovered that the NOx that diesels emit (in larger quantities than gas engines) were also harmful, the efforts to clean up diesel exhaust (which essentially forced the use of more expensive ultra low sulfur diesel) made diesels less efficient and cost competitive with gas engines that also were being designed for efficiency (direct injection, combustion cycles, etc.)","<div class=""md""><p>Don&#39;t overlook the cost element.

"Cost, long term reliability/durability, diesels generally had a much lower initial carbon footprint:

* Diesels were substantially cheaper up front, cheaper to insure, and prior to the super complicated diesel emissions control systems they were substantially cheaper to fix when/if something went wrong all while getting similar fuel economy to a hybrid. Also at that point diesel was cheap so the additional cost was almost never made up.
* Prior to the complicated diesel emissions control systems, a diesel engine could easily hit 500,000 miles without needing anything more than regular maintenance (oil changes, coolant changes, etc.) and a large portion of them hit 1 million miles without any issues. Generally speaking, hybrid batteries only last around 250,000 miles and when they fail it usually makes more financial sense to just buy a new car instead of paying to replace the battery.
* Initial production of an ICE vehicle is less environmentally destructive than producing a hybrid. The resource and emissions breakeven point was typically between 50,000 and 100,000 miles (depending on vehicle class).","<div class=""md""><p>Cost, long term reliability/durability, diesels generally had a much lower initial carbon footprint:</p>

"Diesels can also be hybrid, Mercedes E300 de for example. Diesel and hybrid should never be directly compared because the user demands of a vehicle make one or the other the obvious advantage. If you live in a city, crawl in traffic, and mainly travel alone, hybrid wins, if you regularly tow, cover long distances, and want an engine that will do 400,000 miles with regular maintenance and without the risk of a gargantuan cost in replacing a battery pack, a diesel is a no brainier.

Many Americans would actually be much better off with diesel (mainly the rural or low population density states). 

Hybrid for a majority of road users across the world is a better application. The battery takes the most energy intense struggle of a combustion engine (start stop, breaking vehicle inertia, hard acceleration boost) while also having the major advantage of a partnered combustion engine that can cover colossal distances when demanded with little effort and only the need for any fuel that will combust when compressed of combined with pressure and air (and spark for gas engines)","<div class=""md""><p>Diesels can also be hybrid, Mercedes E300 de for example.

"Performance cars generally have high horsepower. Diesels generally have high torque.

You will need to know this to understand what I'm about to say. It is an easy way to understand torque and hp. **Torque is the amount of weight you can lift. Horsepower is how fast you can lift it.**

Diesels achieve high torque because the stroke, or the distance the piston travels up and down the cylinder is longer than a gasoline engine, and through complicated math and physics, a long stoke equals high torque.

Gasoline engines, especially performance engines generally have a shorter stroke and a larger bore. Bore is the diameter of a cylinder. Having a short stroke and a wide bore allows for high RPM. Complicated equations and other sciency stuff says that the faster an engine spins, the higher horsepower it can achieve.

An engine with a long stroke can not spin as fast as an engine with a short stroke. Because it can not spin as fast, it can not make as much horsepower.

"There are ""performance"" diesels, at least here in Europe. In the US they are not making a lot of sense, because Diesel is more expensive than gasoline.

"Just had a lecture about engine performance on Thursday.
There are 3 ways to increase engine performance:
Engine pressure
Displacement volume
And engine speed.

Let's look at the downsides of diesel engines. Lower engine speed, lower pressure output from unturbo engines, and displacement volume is generally higher.

What this equates to is a heavier engine that is spinning slower and less top speed more torque. 

The reason they are used in big machinery is because weight isn't an issue, high engine speed isn't necessary as torque is more important than top speed and finally superchargers, which steal power from the crankshaft to put it back into the motor are required. These are again heavy, and not what you want to do when your goal is to go fast instead of added power.

Note: A few nuances missed but general ideas still apply","<div class=""md""><p>Just had a lecture about engine performance on Thursday.

"In short it's market demand.  Diesels just never took off in the US and never lost their tractor/agricultural image.

In Europe there are performance diesels although they lend themselves to a rather different style of car and driving. They are exclusively turbocharged and they have high torque but a limited rev range. They don't have the throttle response of a petrol engine, even a petrol turbo engine. As such they work best in the kind of GT car or powerful sedan or estate car role, paired with an automatic gearbox. A lot of the cars are pretty powerful, incredibly torquey,  and very fast. But they're not really sporty owing to weight and throttle response.

I think the US may have missed out for good. Europe is now realising that diesel isn't the environmental panacea it was touted as. Economy isn't as high as stated and it's expensive to refine high quality diesel fuel. Emissions, particularly NOx and particulates which are very harmful to health are high. New emissions specification mean that EGR and diesel particulate systems are being backed up with urea injection... In short the emissions controls we used to have on Power stations  are now expected to fit under the hood of a diesel family car. This is more to go wrong and it's more expensive when it does go  wrong.

With the advent of small capacity high performance petrol turbos, I think the writing is on the wall for high performance diesels.

"I almost made a post about this, but does Japan have a huge 4wd scene that I don't know about?

They've historically had the best 4x4 selection anywhere apart from maybe Aus. They had the Jeep CJ, Cherokee, Chevy S10 Blazer (specially modified for Japan), Patrol, Pajero, Pathfinder, Defender, Toyota Land Cruiser (hundreds series) and 70 Series. They were the only market I know of that sold the both the Prado and 4runner side by side for many years. They got the Mercedes G-wagon. And there are many more.

And they get weird options that you would expect in South Africa where there are isolated areas. Things like swing out spare tire mounts to free up space for auxiliary fuel tanks, locking differentials, and inclinometers. Often they are exclusive to the Japanese market.

Yet they are a island nation that is well known for prioritizing small vehicles and taxing large vehicles. I don't understand why so many companies sold large 4x4 there. Especially considering some them weren't even made in Japan.","<div class=""md""><p>I almost made a post about this, but does Japan have a huge 4wd scene that I don&#39;t know about?</p>

"It's a (very broadly, generally, more my own mojo) consistent feeling across Harry and the other channels I watch.

My broad feeling is since Model X (so before then was for example Model S, i3 REx, Chevy Volt) the EV-and-electrified market shifted to some kind of excess-driven arms race. More about power, not at all about efficiency. Efficiency means smart electrification at a smaller scale than what needs 350kW charging stations (think of the wires for that transmission network).

In my opinion most all manufacturers beyond the most boring mass marketeers (like Toyota, don't hate me, genuine criticism welcome) have been distracted by Tesla's example and have dived headlong too deeply into electrification. The abrupt shift back towards hybrid from the big US makers recently is evidence enough for me.

I don't need a BMW twin-turbo 4.4L with two EV motors and 25kWh of battery pack or whatever, to propel a 3000kg road train to 0-100-0 in city traffic every week. My 1100kg Yaris has less than 1kWh usable EV battery and its fuel economy life (including 1000km highway trips and trips to the shops) has been 3.4L per 100km. Amazingly efficient. 

Give me my Acadia and its naturally aspirated six but with an EV motor in the gearbox for 0-30km/h. I'm sure you can fit 3kWh in amongst that 2000kg. It'd cut the fuel consumption by a third and that's pretty impressive. Do that across every manufacturer - like seatbelts.","<div class=""md""><p>It&#39;s a (very broadly, generally, more my own mojo) consistent feeling across Harry and the other channels I watch.</p>

"I really like his take on this, and the issue with business incentives is bang on. In the UK we have to pay VED every year for cars, which used to be based on emissions, but then it got weird in April 2017. Prior to that, the lower your CO2 emissions, the less VED you had to pay, with plenty of diesels and hybrids facing a bill of £0 per year. After that, you pay £155 per year if your car has *any* local emissions (so only fully electric were £0), and then there was an extra £300 (may be £500) for the first 5 years of the car’s life if it cost most than £30,000 new. Which is stupid, because there are no incentives to pollute less if you buy something like a decent spec Golf TDI over a 5.0L Mustang. The UK’s general environmental vehicle incentives scheme is absolute bollocks and only favours those who can afford to spend £100k+ on a tax write-off.

"TL;DW for the diesel thing - he rotates cars a lot, so depreciation is critical, and the diesel Land Rover was cheaper. He also tows and takes ""long"" trips so a BEV won't meet his needs, which is fair.

He mentions that fleet buyers went for BEVs hardcore due to incentives - I always forget that most UK buyers get cars from their employer, which strikes me as weird but maybe I'm just not used to it.

The rest is the usual anti-EV arguments - insurance/repair cost, battery degradation, charge network issues, cold weather range, CO2 savings not worth it, hydrogen/efuels, etc.

The efficiency one is interesting, at least in the US the efficiency is on the Monroney in both MPG equivalent and kWh/100mi, which is great. Maybe the UK doesn't do that?

He rants about carmakers building heavy, powerful BEVs but er... he just bought a huge Range Rover thing, that is what people buy. Last I checked, there are also plenty of smaller and more efficient BEVs sold in the EU+UK too. Also, power doesn't hurt efficiency that much in an EV, which is pretty awesome - have your cake and floor it too.

So, there are no affordable diesels either and that was made sure of. But some countries like China don’t want any diesels in their cities because of their city population density + added congestion containing carcinogenic particulate matter, as it’s bad enough in their cities.

There is some serious BS going on. And then the elephant in the room, America’s obsession with buying bigger and bigger vehicles than they need to where they can barely drive/park them.

"It depends on what u want from the vehicle. I'll break it down the best i can but I'm no mechanic

Gas- revs much higher, so its considered a peppy engine. If u want performance, go with a gas over diesel any day. Gas tends to have higher horsepower but much lower torque than a diesel. 

Diesel-loads of torque, lower horsepower and doesn't rev very high at all compared to a gas car or truck. I drove a Cummins diesel for a while and it redlined at 3k if that tells you anything. All the torque in the world with fantastic mileage. I got around 25mpg in the truck and had all the power it needed. Diesel cars tend to do much better than that. Yes it was a straight six, but it felt a lot stronger than any v8 truck I've been in

Bottom line is for a truck, personally it absolutely has to be diesel. Yes its more expensive but so worth it. Performance awards would have to be given to gas though for me. Having said that, i ran a 16 flat in that truck and it was a 2005 ram 2500 stock that weighed three and a quarter tons. It was a lot of fun to drive too.

In my area, theres a nice older man who makes Bio-diesel and sells it for only $.50/gal, enough to pay for the massive chemistry set that refines the used/old fast food frying oil and the fuel he uses to go around town once a month to pick it all up.</p>

"Gasoline in a car - it will rev higher and more freely giving you better throttle response. It will also handle better. 

Diesel in a truck - I'm speaking in the hypothetical here, but I would love a half-ton diesel with 250 hp/400 tq if I could get one. I know Dodge is coming out with such a powertrain in the near future, but a Chrysler vehicle with a Fiat powertrain is a maintenance fiasco waiting to happen.","<div class=""md""><p>Gasoline in a car - it will rev higher and more freely giving you better throttle response.

"Ethanol...  generated from sugar or some other means rather than corn like we do here in the US.

It's clean and has amazing power potential that some could argue is better than race gas.  Mileage suffers but under ideal situations (no drought/politics) it can be made cheaply and easily even in your own back yard if you desired.

I personally like the performance aspect and from what I gather race gas may make very slightly more peak horsepower but even 85% ethanol (E85) generates significantly more torque and therefor more usable horsepower for much cheaper even when you account for less mileage.","<div class=""md""><p>Ethanol...  generated from sugar or some other means rather than corn like we do here in the US.</p>

"It's all about how much mileage you cover from year to year. My last car was a  2.2 TDI and it served me well in terms of economy because I was covering about a thousand miles a week. In this case diesel was the preferred option. You have to weigh up:
1. The extra initial cost of a diesel car (usually more expensive to buy than a petrol model). 
2. A diesel car has a shorter service interval for general maintenance, hence more servicing cost over its life. 
3. Some more modern petrol engines are very economical, so perform as well in some cases as petrol models. 

The bottom line is how much mileage are you doing? For me it was diesel for my last car, due to mileage. Now, I drive a petrol car with a nice turbo that's really thirsty, but a great drive.
