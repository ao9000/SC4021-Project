Stopping, standing or parking prohibited in specified places
Vehicle & Traffic (VAT) CHAPTER 71, TITLE 7, ARTICLE 32

l. In a space designated as provided in this subparagraph for the exclusive purpose of charging an electric vehicle at an electric vehicle charging station, unless such vehicle is an electric vehicle connected to such charging station. Provided, however, that an electric motor vehicle disconnected from the electric vehicle charging station for no more than thirty continuous minutes while stopped, standing or parked in such designated space shall not be in violation of this subparagraph. Parking spaces designated for the exclusive purpose of charging an electric vehicle at an electric vehicle charging station shall be clearly identified, and such designation shall include conspicuous and permanently installed above grade signs which shall be positioned from the parking space surface at a height of not less than five feet nor more than seven feet and which identify such space as an electric vehicle charging station, indicate that such space is only for electric vehicle charging and include any day or time restrictions. For the purposes of this subparagraph, the term ""electric vehicle"" shall mean a motor vehicle that is propelled at least in part by an electric motor and associated power electronics which provide acceleration torque to the drive wheels sometime during normal vehicle operation, and that draws electricity from a battery or hydrogen fuel cell that is capable of being recharged from an external source of electricity, such that the
external source of electricity cannot be connected to the vehicle while the vehicle is in motion, and the term ""electric vehicle charging
station"" shall mean the equipment needed to convey electric power from the electric grid or another power source to an onboard motor vehicle

sherlocknoir,"Glad this is happening.   Im not sure about the whole ""selling 10M cars a year thing"".. but Tesla can absolutely sell the shit outta some EV charging.   Its actually crazy it took this long for everybody in US to agree on the NACS connector and to open up the Supercharger network.. but I think thats just it.   Tesla realizes selling millions of cars, is alot harder than charging millions of cars.   And building out new EV charging networks is definitely something nobody else is taking seriously.  


Now I will say as a Model Y owner.. Im definitely looking around at other brands when it comes to trade in my car.   The #1 reason to buy a Tesla when I got mine 3 years ago was the Supercharger network.   If I can get something like a Rivian R1S.. AND still access the Supercharger network.. I'd much rather drive that instead.","<div class=""md""><p>Glad this is happening.

Sestos,"That is one of the two dislikes with EV's currently.

1) Unless in a metro area they do not work due to range. For in and around driving they are great.. lots of chargers from Telsa ones at Wawa to generic something at Walmart near me etc.. But if you have to actually travel... good luck spending extra hours driving our of your way to charge. Same issue if need to haul something, even the Ford Lighting and Rivian nosedive in range if you need to actually tow or haul anything in back.

2) Price and ""eco"" nature. Normally priced similar to a higher trim level but with worst interior due to making it ""eco"" or pricing cuts. If paying lots of money, want real good leather (looks at Telsa). 

Right now best price to what you get seems to be the hybrid models till the range tech gets better and network grows and a company makes a more affordable EV. Most of the car companies are backtracking on full shift to EV's because they are not moving the existing inventory. Same reason some buyers state going back to ICE (range and need to haul stuff). I want to make the jump with my next vehicle but right the tech is just not there.","<div class=""md""><p>That is one of the two dislikes with EV&#39;s currently.</p>

Edward_Hamburgler,"This is a very interesting decision by Tesla. I’ve owned 3 of their cars and they actually had the opportunity to bury all electric competitors by NOT opening their charging infrastructure. It takes so much time and money to just open one single Tesla supercharging location. No other car company has even started to scratch the surface of the network they’ve built, specifically in the USA. 

I’m still kind of scratching my head about this decision. The aggravation to Tesla owners when chargers are full of non Tesla cars is going to be a PR nightmare. Is the incremental revenue of up-charging non Tesla owners a markup on electricity worth it vs a sale of a Tesla?? The fact is they are not going to make very much letting non Tesla cars use their network. It may just slightly defray the build cost of the charging location. The only people this decision is good for are owners of electric vehicles that are not Tesla’s.  If this was Elon’s decision it’s right up there with buying twitter in the dumb department.","<div class=""md""><p>This is a very interesting decision by Tesla.

Brikloss,"My wife was driving my EV6 to go to the pharmacy yesterday. She was going straight through the intersection when an 88 year old man driving a Lexus NX going the opposite direction decided to make his left turn as my wife entered the intersection. She was going approximately 45 mph as she hit the front passenger wheel of the Lexus.  Spun 90° CW and the woman driving a Volvo XC40 behind my wife followed up with hitting the EV6 in the passenger front wheel. 

 My wife hopped out of the car with no injuries other than a few bruises, some muscle pain in her neck and some brush burn from the seatbelt.  Not broken bones. 

Incredibly thankful for Kias Safety engineers hard work. I have no doubts they saved my wife from significant injury. 

Still waiting to hear if it's totaled, but I know the outcome there. 

The car was an AWD GTline that had only 3500 mi on it.  It was a good 3500mi

Edit:

PRO TIP: Do not put anything in your frunk you care about too much.  If you look closely you can see my tire mobility kit is laying in the road near the passenger front tire.   I also had a 12V jumper, my V2L, and some emergency breakdown supplies (like road flares, tire plugs, safety markers etc) in there. 

Everything was destroyed or lost (see ejected into the intersection) EXCEPT the V2L which somehow miraculously survived (though the case has seen better days).  I'm giving it to my wife for her Ioniq 5 as they don't come with the adapter and my new GV60 will come with one. 

The thought occurred to me when I was putting them in the frunk that exactly this could happen, but I did the ""I've never been in an accident in 20 years of driving, it'll be fine"".","<div class=""md""><p>My wife was driving my EV6 to go to the pharmacy yesterday.

eepluribus,"Located in Sarasota, calculated peak load was 1.4kw from the car, but it seemed to run steady at 200w all night, whichmakes sense being that the fridge was already cold and just needed to maintain.

We have had a fan, the light, charging devices, and fridge running non stop since 8:15pm (9/28) and as of 6:20am (9/29) we have used 5% of the EV6's battery, from 96% to 91%. It appears that the local FPL EVolution DCFC station is operational as well, which makes sense if it's considered critical infrastructure like a gas station would be and have reinforced power supply lines. 

As a native Floridian having gone through Charlie, Ivan, and Irma, along with many more hurricanes, this is honestly better than having a generator for this. It makes no sound, no gas to refill, no guessing how much gas it still has, I can easily monitor from the app, and it took no setup time.

Long overdue edit but this post seems to still garner attention, so I wanted to follow up with what actually happened in the end. They went for 4.5 days with no power, running what you see in the vid, and also adding in the TV after this vid. They also had a portable incudtion stove top, coffee pot, and some other stuff they used with the understanding that they needed to unplug the fridge to prevent too much power draw during use. After the 4.5 days of this constant use, it started at 96% as mentioned, and my parents did the favor of driving my car back to me across town, I got it back at 54%.

TangerineEffective30,"Hi,

I didn't want to start a post about simple quetsion, so I'll throw it in here, because it's a bit realted to GT vs GT-Line. 

On the Kia website, the GT-Line is listed, underlights, as having ""Cold Weather Ready w/ Range Preserving Heat Pump System"".

For the GT, this description is specifically not mentioned.

So I found that odd, and I don't understand.

What is the difference between the versions in this regard to this line? I assume both versions have battery pre-conditioning, right?

Thanks in advance.","<div class=""md""><p>Hi,</p>

exotic_craze,"Here's the project details in case anyone is interested: 

The base was made from 18mm untreated plywood. 

Front pieces: 
1020x650 at their widest, 510 thinnest 

Rear piece:
900x1020 at its widest, 940 thinnest 

Box section:
900x890 wide
210 at its deepest, 140 shallowest
Front face is 2x18mm ply lengths sandwiched together. One supports the front sections while the other supports the rear piece. With the false floor removed, this box fits snugly within the subfloor and doesn't shift around. 

After these were all cut to size I finished the pieces with a stain and attached some rubber to the edges in hopes of preventing any scratches to the cars interior. 

The rear piece pulls out to form a table and locks into place. This is achieved through a couple of interlocking aluminum angles on the rear piece and box section that I've attempted to show in the photos. 

The front pieces lock into the box section through two aluminum angles, which prevent them pivoting upwards if weight is put near their front. Each piece is also secured through two locating bolts to stop them sliding around while driving. Both pieces are supported by the backs of the rear seats in their folded down position. 

As for the curtians, I ordered a custom sunshade for the windshield. All the other ""curtains"" were cut to size from cheap one-size-fits-all sunshades. I then glued some fabric to their inside faces just to make it all a bit more homely. These pieces all fit nicely inside the interior window beads and hold themselves in place. The rear window is the only exception as I had to use some clear 3M hooks along the top. 

The mattress is a ""Deluxe Double Sleeping Mat"" from Macpac. It's a self inflating air mattress and measures 2×1.3m and 10cm thick when inflated. It gets a bit squished at the rear of the car but still fits nicely. 

I've spent a few nights in it so far and I'm very happy with the setup. I'll shortly be setting off on a 3wk road trip which will be the real test for its usability. 

Best of luck to anyone crazy enough to try something similar themselves!","<div class=""md""><p>Here&#39;s the project details in case anyone is interested: </p>

buttery_nurple,"For whatever it’s worth, if I could call 1-year-ago me to say we’d own not one, but two Kia EVs, I’d have advised myself to stop huffing paint.

My wife insisted on driving the EV9 before we committed to a Rivian. I was very much against buying anything from Kia but it honestly took all of 1 minute driving that thing to realize I was completely wrong.  It’s phenomenal, and continues to floor me with how good it is 3 months later.

So good that I went back and bought an EV6 GT for myself the next month. Also phenomenal, just different phenomenal.

Anyway I’m very biased now, but you made a good choice. Congrats.

One thing, the Tesla autopilot nag? You can handle that by sliding one of the steering wheel scroll buttons, you don't have to jiggle the actual steering wheel.

[deleted],"Thanks for the great write-up. I've only driven a Model Y Performance for an hour or so test drive, but I have a RWD EV6 now with close to 7k miles. 

I agree with almost everything you've written. I haven't had any issues with the Kia App other than it's design, it's always worked for me, so maybe it's your modem.

I've had some issue with the driver assistance in the Kia. For some reason, it likes to take off-ramps or follow the painted lines into turn lanes in town. I haven't driven a Tesla on the highway, so haven't seen the phantom brake issues, but I prefer their implementation for in-town driving... Wish my Kia could see traffic lights.

Would love for the room and storage of the Y. 3 kids and luggage to the airport was tight.

I have the GTLine, so I'll make some other comments in case someone is still researching. I loved the interior.  Didn't think I'd care for the HUD, but I love it and I think that's a miss for the Y. I also love the lighting in the GTLine. My door handles auto present and I love that as well, on par with the Y, although I wish the Kia also just went with a key card. The control from the key fob for parking in the Kia is also fantastic and something I didn't think I'd use as often as I do. It's great to back the car out with getting in to pull my bike or trash cans out of the garage. 

They one thing I don't have is the power or speed that I want. I wish I would have bought the AWD, but I'm glad I have the features of the GTLine. 

Finally, I did have a tiny paint run on the Kia. I have the matte grey paint and was told it's next to impossible to match. I'm debating if it's even worth going through the hassle of being without a car for weeks to a month, only to find the pain not possibly matching and it looking worse. The dealership had not been very helpful and I think they just want me to go away. Tbf, I bought out of state, because I won't pay over MSRP. So yeah, Kia makes a great car, but they aren't any better than Tesla when it comes to paint.","<div class=""md""><p>Thanks for the great write-up.

SlickNetAaron,"Beauty! Welcome to the club. I’m sure you’ll love it.

Get the PlugShare and A Better Route Planner to help plan longer trips. Don’t assume chargers work. You’ll need several apps for charging. Most don’t allow you to walk up, swipe credit card and charge. You often have to use an App, fund a wallet.. kinda a pain. Be prepared for a drastic drop in range when you decide to tow. 

Make sure to educate yourself on caring for the matte paint. Only touchless car washes and I think need to clean off bugs right away. I believe you can’t polish, buff or wax the paint :grimacing_face:

Also, make sure you get software updates. Kia won’t install several of them without you saying you have a specific problem. There’s posts on here at least weekly.

Enjoy! There’s some things to be aware of with an EV, but over the course of a year with home charging, the experience is SoOoo much better than gas.","<div class=""md""><p>Beauty! Welcome to the club. I’m sure you’ll love it.</p>

CertifiedSeattleite,"I’m at nearly 30k miles after 18 months with our 2022 GT-Line (same matte grey paint, head up display and wheels) The infamous 12v onboard battery has been the only problem we’ve had - not sure if they put a better battery in the FE trim. Easy DIY fix once it happens, but you just need to be ready because there’s no warning.  Our first EV as well - it’s a blast to drive, and is surprisingly agile in the snow and on rough forest service roads.  Charging overnight at home on a 240 volt / adjustable amperage charger is the way to go, even if you’ve got free EA charging.  We park on the street in front of our house, but it was relatively easy and fairly cheap to split the washer/dryer outlet and install a heavy duty covered outlet on the side of the house. From there we use a (long) heavy duty RV extension cord to charge the car 2-3 nights a week. Charge time is 7-10 hours depending on whether you go to 80-100%  If you have a garage with a 240 outlet it’s obviously a lot easier lol.","<div class=""md""><p>I’m at nearly 30k miles after 18 months with our 2022 GT-Line (same matte grey paint, head up display and wheels) The infamous 12v onboard battery has been the only problem we’ve had - not sure if they put a better battery in the FE trim.

M0U53YBE94,"We also have a first edition 861 in urban yellow.

Get the navigation updated then take it to the dealer have it updated then you have to complain about dcfc in the winter for them to apply the charging update. [Here is a tsb image](https://www.reddit.com/r/KiaEV6/comments/12imb50/pre_conditioning_for_ev6/). This will get you the precondition update for full speed dcfc in winter months. 

In the southeast charging isn't that big of a deal. And charge point is exploding in the south east as well. though they are mostly 150kw and lower units though. Most EA stations that have had a free 350 kw dispenser have given me full speed. Even in 100 plus degree temps.

Something we have found out though. Do not adjust the climate during a dcfc session. Doing so will immediately error out the charging and you will have to start again. IDK if this is a wide spread issue or a our car issue.

techorules,It’s a great car especially considering it’s a first year model. Only quibble is the supposedly upgrade stereo is pretty much garbage. Ok maybe not garbage. But it definitely stinks when compared to ANY so called upgraded car stereo I’ve had in last 20 years.  The steering is a bit dull / dead but it’s precise enough. Everything else I dare say is luxury car level.   The tech is superb. Really top notch. The ride is excellent. Battery is massive. Lots of room. Super looks.

the1joe2,"Thank you for posting this, the info is very timely and helpful for me!

I'm between an EV6 and an ID4 and I do not qualify for the EV tax credit due to the income limits so I've been trying to better understand how I can leverage the lease loophole to my advantage. My preference would be to buy out the lease immediately but I'm trying to understand if that's worth while with the extra taxes and fees that I wouldn't otherwise pay on a cash purchase.

Is either brand's finance company better, cheaper, or easier to work with than the other for this lease->buyout scenario?

Also, for context, I'm in Ohio which as I understand from your post may have issues with double taxation.

When all is said and done, is the juice worth the squeeze to get at least some of the $7500 incentive that I couldn't otherwise get?

&#x200B;

I recently went into a dealer to discuss a trade in for Ioniq 5 sel (also wanted to know how much the lease numbers were looking like) and I was told I have negative equity for my car and they were asking for 5k down + $1335 dest, +650 bank fee, + tax,dmv,1st months payment for 12k/36 393 per month.

Could I get Kia's 1.5% financing on new car purchases if I switched to this on a trade in?  Because if I could, the reduced interest would help make up for the price hike.

Edit to add: when I was shopping for my first car (this was 17 years ago now), there was a car we *almost* went with.  We wound up passing on it because it had a check engine light that just wouldn't go away, and that made my mechanic of a father nervous about what kind of a money pit the car would turn into.  So we didn't get it.  But if memory serves right, it was a 1997 Oldsmobile Achieva coupe...in dark green...with a tan interior.  I loved the look of it.

lobotiger,"Good summary and we're both kind of similar in ownership.  I have a 2019 Model 3 SR+ and the wife drives the 2023 Kia EV6 GT-Line 2.  Had to go with the Line 2 because it had the powered rear hatch which was one thing I didn't like about Kia/Hyundai.  Why wouldn't you include such a simple thing in the lower trims?  Since I get a chance to drive hers every now and then, I can certainly related to your findings.

When we were looking to replace her SUV, we did consider the Model Y for the longest time.  But then they started going (way) up in price and Tesla started removing/changing features that my car still had.  That pushed us to the EV6 which the wife liked the look of.  The many glowing reviews also helped in solidifying our decision.  I have to say that I sometimes prefer driving hers to mine.  It's a much smoother and quieter ride and having that HUD is a bonus.  I never minded buttons and knobs like others do so having some of them back is perfectly fine for me.  

It's too bad how Tesla has changed since I first got onboard with them.  Back in 2019 it did feel like you were driving the future and the features and stuff were amazing.  But today, there's more competition and even if I had to replace my SR+ I don't know that I would right away go back to another Tesla.  There's too much ""stuff"" that's changed on them like the USS being gone and still the lack of a proper rain sensor that people have been asking for for years.  One day  last year I had to constantly be fiddling with the wipers in my SR+ because there was just enough spray hitting the windshield that it needed wiping but not enough for the camera to detect it needed to wipe.  :(  And the basic autopilot is not as good as when I first used it.  Because of the constant OTA updates it's changed somehow to the point that in stop and go traffic it will buck forwards and stop just like a newbie driver would.  Compare that to the EV6's HDA2 where it's still buttery smooth in that kind of scenario.

Congrats on the EV6 and if you want to trade more comparisons feel free to reach out.","<div class=""md""><p>Good summary and we&#39;re both kind of similar in ownership.

lowercasejames,"I just switched from a Model Y (2020) and I couldn't be happier. The drive is so much smoother and more reactive than the MY, and the fit and finish of the car does feel miles ahead of Tesla's minimalist, soulless interior. There are some quirks, like I miss my MyQ integration for the garage door, or the gear dial (which I am sure I'll get used to)... but being able to quickly engage sport mode and switch back to eco is a huge plus. The pedals for regen control are an absolute must, especially if you have in home charging and aren't worried about regen for anything other than long distance commuting. It's great to get around DC, and I expect when the charging network becomes more reliable it will be a super fun roadtrip car.  


People ask why I made the switch... Tesla really just declined in customer service and features overall. When I came on board, it felt like a different product and company. I'll spare my thoughts on Elon Musk - picking a car based on corporate leadership is a silly premise. But I can say as Tesla started ""upgrading"" their software, the experience was ultimately impacted. Also I didn't know I was being indoctrinated into a monolith of same-looking, vanilla vehicles when I signed on. Where I live they're everywhere now, and the novelty of having a weird little space ship looking thing wore off when Superchargers were as crowded as In-N-Out drive-thru east of the Mississippi.","<div class=""md""><p>I just switched from a Model Y (2020) and I couldn&#39;t be happier.

Glad you did your research and watched reviews I have been watching reviews on all electric cars for the past year and a half and still haven't made up my mind on what I want.

I'm a kia guy, so planned on going with the ev6 but missing a good amount of things I'm looking for.

I want to know if anyone can share how much is the charger total cost to hook up into your service at your house? Also are US residents still getting 7500.00 rebates?

alexwhittemore,"Agree pretty much point by point with everything.

>Apple CarKey - I've heard that the hardware is there for it, would absolutely LOVE this feature. Especially if it means I can just get in the car and drive like Tesla that'd be amazing.

I can't say with absolute certainty that the hardware is NOT there for it, but I started pretty confident it is, and now I am pretty confident it's not after reading FCC filings. What I personally really want is just RFID key cards, and the Ioniq 5 already has that option. Excellent way to do watersports - leave your key in an RF shielding bag inside the car and just take your plastic card with you while you dive/surf/swim/whatever.

Apple Car Key comes in two flavors - tap-to-unlock and tap-to-drive NFC-based (which the I5 will support), and ultrawideband-based hands-free ""approach the car and go."" There is no evidence to suggest either car has ultrawideband hardware (the chips DON'T use that), and it's expensive AF so it'd be a huge shock to me to find out it/they do.

>Wireless Carplay - apparently the hardware is there for it, they're just going to turn it on in an update?

There was a thread this morning that a canadian owner magically got wireless carplay in their car by manually installing an update meant for the Sorrento. I'm not sure how confident we can be in that report, but it's certainly encouraging. At least one other person says ""the latest update got me wireless android auto"" so either we're getting trolled hard or the software IS getting rolled out, if only to other 10.5"" infotainment cars.","<div class=""md""><p>Agree pretty much point by point with everything.</p>

You mean your state. They're why the Connect is that way not Kia. Your gripe is with Mass. It's weird to blame Kia for one state's law. Don't expect a workaround from their standpoint. I doubt they're interested in tiptoeing some grey area to make it happen. It's only one state causing this problem so it's really their problem and not Kia's as I'm sure that law is negatively impacting a lot of software as a service.

Outside of that I can totally see your other points, though I'm really surprised you're okay with the sound system.

Frubanoid,"For audio, there have been a lot of complaints about the speakers. They can be pretty good in my opinion, but it took at least an hour of listening to different settings and figuring out the best sounding EQ and even the best volume to listen to for a balanced sound (around 40). Besides EQ, there are audio settings like ""immersion"" to play with.

Also, this update is for ALL EV6 in the USA, even base model Light. Fortunately Kia equipped all EV6 in the USA with the needed battery PTC heater.

When going in for the update, it would also be good to get these other updates at the same time, if you've not already:

1. Remote start Fahrenheit to Celsius bug: [https://www.kiaevforums.com/threads/sa513-datc-logic-improvement-for-celsius-to-fahrenheit-conversion.5181/](https://www.kiaevforums.com/threads/sa513-datc-logic-improvement-for-celsius-to-fahrenheit-conversion.5181/)
2. i-pedal software update: [https://www.kiaevforums.com/threads/sa533-service-action-vcu-software-upgrade-for-i-pedal-operation.7671/](https://www.kiaevforums.com/threads/sa533-service-action-vcu-software-upgrade-for-i-pedal-operation.7671/)

Not sure what the i-pedal update does, but a common complaint was that the brake lights were not coming on under heavy deceleration, it was so bad that other drivers would sometimes stop and alert EV6 drivers that their brake lights were not working.

I plan on getting all 3 of the above done, if you have issues where your car stops charging at home, also get this one done:
