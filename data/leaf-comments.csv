UPVOTINGYOURUGLYPETS,"Quite low range estimate since it's really cold in Finland now :D

Big thanks to Muxsan! I snapped this picture right after I got the car to successfully boot without going into Turtle mode with the ""Invalid Battery ID"" TDC. I think the 40kWh swaps into 2011-2015 Leafs are really going to take off soon, the amount of crashed 2018 are only gonna increase.

Shameless plug for my website and forum thread for more information.

CheetahChrome,"> Closed on a house two weeks ago

We were in the process of selling our house in Colorado, with two weeks before the closing and got hit with an EF1 tornado which ripped up an estimated 10 thousand trees in the area. We had two trees, evergreens, which fell... fortunately *we didn't have any Leaf's parked near the trees at the time*. But ended up with 2K less in our wallets by closing due to the cost to remove the said trees.

Fun fact...HOA sent me a letter roughly two weeks after the event, and a week-ish after the close on the house, complaining about missing grass in the front yard that the tree used to cover, but now was open dirt. *Not my circus, not my monkey...anymore*.

1. Always call the charging network while on my way to the charger, and look at the plug share app check-in comments. And choose an alternative station, if needed.  

2. Use ABRP ( A Better Route Planner) and Leaf Spy Pro together. Leaf Spy Pro can share data with ABRP. 

3. Carry my EVSE Charging cord and a 25 foot heavy duty (AWG 10) outdoor rated extension cord to allow emergency charging at L1 (120 V ) outlets, or RV parks L2 ( 240 V ) where there are NEMA 14-50 outlets, that are also available at some campgrounds. 

4. NACS to J1772 adapter, to allow charging at Tesla (NACS) 120/240 (L1/L2) charging locations. Available at some hotels. Sadly, it does not work at superchargers. 

5. Looking into purchasing a CCS to ChaDeMo adapter ( ref: see Dala on YouTube video) hopefully the price will come down and it will work with CCS1 not just CCS2 charges.

Mhandley9612,"My work has free charging, about 5 units that go about 6 kw when only one person is plugged in per unit and 3kw when two people are plugged in. There are many ev’s at my work. I once came out to unplug my car (2 hour sessions) to find me and the Tesla plugged into the same unit are unplugged and someone even closed my charging port. I could tell it wasn’t the Tesla because he still had his adapter plugged in and port open because those stay locked. I just don’t understand why a person would unplug anyone. Especially with how it’s set up at work since once the charger goes back into the unit, it alerts the next person in line. Well if there’s still a car parked there, then that person is going to waste their time trying to move their car just to be stuck and have to report that spot at unusable and get back in line. It just causes so many problems on top of the fact that there’s no reason to unplug me. I went out within the 15 minutes given after the time ended.

trevor3310,"Our LEAF journey: We owned a 2013 LEAF S (post 8/2013 battery) and have loved the car ever since we first test-drove it in 2014. It spend the majority of its life in Oregon and we shipped it to Virginia in 2019 where it still resides. After learning about the 30kWh batteries in the 2016 and 2017 LEAFs and the upgrade to a 40kWh I was on a hunt since 2020 to find one that would fit the bill for a replacement. We finally found one in Cincinnati Ohio that fit the bill: a 2017 SV, 9/12 SoH bars, and 70,000 miles. We ended up paying $12,000 for the 2017 LEAF. 

  
After long conversations with the owner, we bought plane tickets to pick up the car and drive it home. In short, it was 95-degree weather, 500+ miles home, mostly QC which at the end we were pulling only 11kw, turtle mode after the third QC (I have pictures if you’re interested), 11/12 heat bars, greatly reduced acceleration, and LOADS of luck. We made the trip in less than 24 hours which I thought was fantastic. Using LeafSpy, we found that the car needed only a few more % to go before it dropped down to 8 bars. We didn’t do anything to try to speed up the process although our road trip probably did a lot of the damage. 

  
We got home and posted our 2013 LEAF S for sale which was in great condition. It had 65,000 miles and 10/12 SoH bars remaining. We posted it at the height of the used car market for $12,000 and ended up selling it to someone for $11,000. They were fully aware of the limitations of the car, or so they told us, and we went on our merry way. 

  
A few weeks later we jumped in the car and it had 8/12 battery bars. We went to the nearest Nissan dealership, Passport Nissan of Alexandria, and we were ready with the car manual and warranty information to point it out to them should they not know what we were talking about. We walked in and told them we had a LEAF and that we would like to claim the 8/12 battery bar warranty on our 2017 LEAF. They knew exactly what we were talking about and took the car in for diagnostics without charging us any fee. They had the car in the shop for a day or two then told us it needs a new battery and that they would get the process started. They asked us if we would like to keep the car or have a loaner for the duration of the wait. We opted to keep the LEAF but after the car nearly died on us on the highway we called and they got us into a loaner the same day. It was a Rogue and I hated it. The thing was gutless and I missed my instant acceleration. 

  
We got the call this afternoon to pick up the car and hopped on in and it had over 160 miles on the GOM. We were excited and now ready for our next road trip longer than 100 miles. 

  
The total process time was about 6 months from the claim. When I went in today our service advisor tuned the computer and he said the battery cost $18.5K new and he was shocked. Excited for the future, AMA!","<div class=""md""><p>Our LEAF journey: We owned a 2013 LEAF S (post 8/2013 battery) and have loved the car ever since we first test-drove it in 2014.

LoveEV-LeafPlus,"UPDATED: Spelling corrections, Grammar and a #7.
Overall the Leaf is a great car, and I truly love this  Electric Vehicle (EV). Since I have had three, a 2018 SL, a 2019 SL Plus, and now a 2023 SV Plus. I very much Love this EV, its comfort, ride and available technology and safety features.  I am sure you will love yours as much as I have loved the one I have and the ones that I had in the past. 

I recommend looking into getting the Leaf Spy Pro App and a ODB2 (On Board Diagnostic v2)  dongle to allow you to self monitor your vehicle. The dongle I have is from Carista. There are others and when you read the help on line about leaf spy pro, it gives recommendations on the dongle(s) “du jour”. 

The only issues I’ve had over the years were minor. Mostly irritations and again only minor. Below are ones to look out for, based on my experiences, and are in no particular order. 

1. This car does not like pot holes, three tires and one rim had to be replaced over the years. Avoid pot holes if at all possible. 

2. The Infotainment system sometimes reboots for no apparent reason. If you are using navigation, “Don’t Panic”, after a minute or so it reboots. Hopefully you don’t miss your exit. I use my phone mapping app as a backup. 

3. Using the wired Car Play for phone calls sometimes has the receive audio gurgled and is unintelligible when this occurs. The work-around solution is to switch phone audio to Bluetooth by disconnecting the usb cable from the phone. So be sure to set up Bluetooth to the phone too. 

4. Sometimes the Navigation system Audio guidance goes silent. It still shows the map guidance correctly, But on a whim stops talking. 

5. The Navigation system on the 2023 has not been able to navigate on 5 to 6 occasions and instead displays a screen dialog box with  “Could Not Find A Route”.  It did it once more recently.  Even replacing the navigation Electronic Control Unit (ECU) did not solve this random issue. This has occurred ONLY on my 2023 Leaf SV Plus , that has a little over 5,000 miles on it.      

  I now know, that the work-around solution for “Could Not Find A Route” is to force a Navigation System reboot by pressing and holding both the volume and tune knobs for 10 seconds to reboot the system. Alternatively, Turning off the vehicle and waiting at least an hour or overnight will have the system working once again.  

However, Now that I know how to force a Navigation/Infotainment system reboot, when this occurs, I can instead of waiting, just quickly reset the system and be able to navigate. This reboot also resets the voice guidance sound issue too. 

6.  The EVConnect telematics application back end server systems, are not perfect by any means. When it is up and running, it is truly wonderful.  When there is an outage, it is irritating and the outages last longer than other telematics services I have used in the past. 

7. The Charge Time (Est.) screen, only on my 2023 SV Plus, does not show the estimated time to a full charge, while charging. Nissan Engineering has been informed about this, and so far has not found a solution.","<div class=""md""><p>UPDATED: Spelling corrections, Grammar and a #7.
Overall the Leaf is a great car, and I truly love this  Electric Vehicle (EV). Since I have had three, a 2018 SL, a 2019 SL Plus, and now a 2023 SV Plus. I very much Love this EV, its comfort, ride and available technology and safety features.  I am sure you will love yours as much as I have loved the one I have and the ones that I had in the past. </p>

<p>I recommend looking into getting the Leaf Spy Pro App and a ODB2 (On Board Diagnostic v2)  dongle to allow you to self monitor your vehicle. The dongle I have is from Carista. There are others and when you read the help on line about leaf spy pro, it gives recommendations on the dongle(s) “du jour”. </p>

<p>The only issues I’ve had over the years were minor. Mostly irritations and again only minor. Below are ones to look out for, based on my experiences, and are in no particular order. </p>

<ol>
<li><p>This car does not like pot holes, three tires and one rim had to be replaced over the years. Avoid pot holes if at all possible. </p></li>
<li><p>The Infotainment system sometimes reboots for no apparent reason. If you are using navigation, “Don’t Panic”, after a minute or so it reboots. Hopefully you don’t miss your exit. I use my phone mapping app as a backup. </p></li>
<li><p>Using the wired Car Play for phone calls sometimes has the receive audio gurgled and is unintelligible when this occurs. The work-around solution is to switch phone audio to Bluetooth by disconnecting the usb cable from the phone. So be sure to set up Bluetooth to the phone too. </p></li>
<li><p>Sometimes the Navigation system Audio guidance goes silent. It still shows the map guidance correctly, But on a whim stops talking. </p></li>
<li><p>The Navigation system on the 2023 has not been able to navigate on 5 to 6 occasions and instead displays a screen dialog box with  “Could Not Find A Route”.  It did it once more recently.  Even replacing the navigation Electronic Control Unit (ECU) did not solve this random issue. This has occurred ONLY on my 2023 Leaf SV Plus , that has a little over 5,000 miles on it.      </p>

Kool_Ken,"I have also purchased a leaf under the same circumstances. I have free charging at work which is a 30 mile drive. bought a 2013 leaf at only 40% SOH for $3500. It was takes me there and back no problem but adding any detors was out of the questian. Its been saving me $400 a month in gas. the situation as it stands has been working great, but ive fallen in love with the car and started looking into a new battery. Im in the bay area and started with getting qoutes from a shop in oregan and down in irvine ca. here are the price range comparsons i got:

QC charge in irvine Ca : 13k to 14k for a 40kWh 15k to 16k for the 60kWh

EV rides in portland:  a little cheaper then QC but had a 30 kwh option for around 8k

Nissan in gilroy Ca 6/05/2022 estimate: $9300 for OEM

Biggest diffrence to me is tha ev rides a qc use somewhat unknown used batteries that are only have so much of a guarantee. Nissan offers a brand new battery that comes with 2 waranties.  Battery and work performed on the battery are covered for 8 years 100k miles. It is also guarenteed to not fall under 9 bars within 5 years 60k miles. 

One scary thing is the waranty is void if the title is salvaged. so there is the whole risk of money spent vs value of car in the unfortunate event of an accident. I will look into some kind of appraisal of the car maybe? i havent really crossed that bridge yet. i plan on calling my isurance company for that information.","<div class=""md""><p>I have also purchased a leaf under the same circumstances.

Paelidore,"Looks a lot like my Electric Barbarella(2016 S) minus the wheels.

And When you select ""D"" for ""Drive"", if you select it again, it shows ""B"". This is for more aggressive regenerative braking - which I also prefer.  


Have fun and enjoy your new experience. The quiet is wonderful as is how smooth the ride is for me - and the odd benefits, holy cow!

runwithpugs,"Cool!

My work installed 10 free stations about 10 years ago, and this was a big factor in my decision to buy my Leaf back in 2012. I was the 4th EV driver to start using them. As people started to notice us charging in the parking lot, more and more took the EV plunge like I did.

Soon we had enough EVs charging that someone set up an email list to coordinate swapping out cars. After 7 or 8 years, we had over 60 EV drivers sharing 10 chargers (sometimes more like 7 or 8, when aging hardware broke and needed repair). For the most part, it all worked. People with longer range who didn't need to charge every day would skip days. If someone was on a tight schedule and needed a full charge, people would try to accommodate that. And if you were flexible enough, you'd usually get the charge you needed. Of course, there was the occasional annoying case of someone forgetting to move their car after finishing and blocking a station while in meetings all day.

A couple years ago they installed 65 new stations and decommissioned the old ones. The new ones cost money to use, but it's reasonable and generally a little bit cheaper than residential electricity rates. There's always available stations now, with people who don't bother using them, plus some amount of working from home since the pandemic.

The only annoying thing now is the two Prius Primes who always take the closest spots and are never plugged in when I see them! They obviously get there super early so I don't know if they finish charging before I get there and go out to unplug (but not move... why??). Or if they literally think these are special privileged EV parking spaces. I'd complain but it seems silly when there's never a shortage of available stations farther out. It's just irritating when the signage clearly says the spaces are for EV ***charging*** only!","<div class=""md""><p>Cool!</p>

tehrealbdeal,"So after seeing a bunch of ads for $99/month 2024 Leaf lease deals, I called every Nissan dealer in a 100 mile range and got quotes. The first five all had hidden fees and were unable to get anywhere close to the numbers from the ads. My last attempt was Boulder Nissan, where not only were they 100% up front about what the initial payment would be, but also had 2023s available for $79/month. After a few phone calls, I was actually offered a 2023 with a few miles on it for even cheaper than the advertised price.  

Ended up picking up this 2023 S, 10,000 mi/year, for $1140 initial payment including first month, $76/month including a $5000 damage waiver. Entire process could not have been easier. Big shout-out to the guys at Boulder Nissan and I guess the lawmakers in Colorado for having big ole EV rebates.","<div class=""md""><p>So after seeing a bunch of ads for $99/month 2024 Leaf lease deals, I called every Nissan dealer in a 100 mile range and got quotes.

I just spoke to Nissan customer service and they lowered the price of their 24 kilowatt hour battery to approximately $5,495. They're 40 kilowatt battery is now $12,495. They are discontinuing the 30 kilowatt hour battery and replacing those cars batteries with their 40 kilowatt hour battery. They have still yet to announce this which is odd and they will not install a 40 kilowatt hour in a 24 kilowatt hour equipped car. I told them about Fenix Power and that Fenix power will be the best solution because your batteries with a small subscription price every month will be kept at maximum capacity and you'll always be at 12 capacity bars..

I wasn’t planning to get the Leaf, so I don’t know much about past iterations, but this thing is sweet af. The assisted driving controls are perfect for a long trip or bumper-to-bumper traffic. The Bose speakers are killer (I’m a musician, so definitely a necessity).

A few questions:

Can you clarify what the purpose of the wiring kit is?  It seems all you need to do is connect any inverter rated for over 1000 watts to the battery terminals under the hood.  Could you just use jumper cables?

And as for the 120V cables coming from the inverter, did you plug them into outlets to backfeed the house or did you just run an extension cord and connect to that directly.  If the former, did you power both phases with separate cords or just half the house?","<div class=""md""><p>Thanks for posting this!  I didn&#39;t realize it would be so easy to retrofit this.</p>

MrDataViz,"After many months of determining if, or not, an EV would suite my needs, I decided to go with a used EV instead of an ICE. I was hesitant in the beginning because for fear of running out of juice and being stranded. Researching about the charging infrastructure here in San Antonio Tx, confirmed my decision to take the plunge. Currently, CPS Energy has a program for EV owners that allows you to pay $60 annually to charge for free at any of their designated charging stations. That’s a no brainer since that was a full tank of fossil fuel a week before the EV! In addition, the City has a parking program that allows EVs to park for free at city owned lots, very handy since I work downtown. 

I ended up with a 2015 SL, 85 mile range Leaf. Seems like it’s the loaded version because it has HIDs, leather seats, and nice wheels. It really beats the Chevy bolt I was first looking at. So far my kids love it, especially my 8 year old who says she like my car since, “we are not polluting the environment.”

I still have range anxiety since this is my first EV but reading the comments on various forums it will subside. But so far so good.

1. Join the SanAntonioEV group (can't post FB links but search it)!

Two adults in the front, two children under 7 in the back in Diono seats, and a 55kg dog in the boot. All just fine thanks to all the safety of the car and child restraints.

After they impact, I was convinced my dog was going to be flattened, but the chassis was hit first keeping enough of the boot intact.

Was hit by a truck. Car boot was crushed until the tow hook from the truck hit the chassis.

Not sure if the air bag was meant to deploy, but the bumper sensor was completely missed and looks ok, even the polystyrene looks like new.

Was rammed into other cars Infront despite having my foot on the break so hard I was not in my seat.

marzman95,"This seems as a good innovation. However this price seems to be too high. I do understand that it is a new innovation and the demand is high, but it is the same price as having an extra feature installed in a brand new car. Instead of it being priced as a tool, it is priced as a car feature.

I recently bought a second hand leaf and was a bit disappointed by the ChaDeMo availability. Yes, the move to EV’s would have been the perfect opportunity to streamline charging, and it is disappointing that this didn’t happen. However, for fossil fuel we also have different types and there is no issue at all getting the right type for your vehicle. I think the charger station providers really should put more work in providing both options. Especially because the amount of ChaDeMo cars seems to be significant still.

Hopefully other (European) companies are also looking into making such converters, and hopefully make them cheaper. I do not like ordering expensive stuff in China, found out that the quality does not justify the high price, and not being covered by warranty because it is not being sold as an European product.","<div class=""md""><p>This seems as a good innovation.

I just posted on another thread, I believe getting the bigger battery is a great choice, if you can afford it. I just posted over on the other thread too, look for the YouTube video about the shock tower struts, you open the hood and pop out the two little plastic ""grilles"" on each side, and get some additional grease on them. Nissan left them to rust to shreds on the early LEAFS, luckily I found out and saved mine on my 2011. In Phoenix, so definitely prudent to follow the rules and not charge to 100% in high heat (is there ever a time in Phoenix when there isn't high heat?) and leave it like that for any period of time.

I do love that color, dramatic. I debated and debated. But ultimately, you can't get the silver interior, so I picked blue.

Some friendly tips

* Remember that slow charging is best charging when concerned about degradation.
* Try to keep your juice between 20%-80%.
* ""B"" is the same as ""D"" but with more aggressive breaking.
* Range anxiety isn't a serious issue. It'll pass!
* Check to see if you get tax credits. I got all my taxes back in Louisiana for registering mine!
* If you're used to old junkers like I was before I got mine, I recommend driving in Eco mode, lol!","<div class=""md""><p>I named mine Electric Barbarella. The LEAF is my first electric car, and I&#39;m in LOVE! I hope you have so much fun with your LEAF.  </p>

jevenm,"This sounds pretty encouraging.

EV battery warranty newby here.

I'm in canada, very mild climate in my area and don't drive much at all (though family members could help put miles on it) and I have a few questions.

So I'm \*planning\* on buying a used 2016 leaf S with 12 bars. It's from an independent dealer, not a nissan dealer or kia dealer or anything, and they said this car has battery warranty until 160k km, and that this vehicle qualifies for an extended warranty covering the battery for an additional 4 years.

1. So.... what does all of that mean?
2. Even though this car is from a small dealer, I'd still bring in the car to a nissan dealer once the time comes (and end up being approved) for a battery replacement?
3. Would it be better if I just buy a similar leaf (with battery warranty) that has like 11 or 10 bars instead of 12, to give me a better chance of having enough battery degradation in time to be eligible for a new battery?
4. Should I just try to get a used 2016 leaf SV instead since it has the 30 kWh battery which would mean I'd get a 40 kWh replacement?

side note: I've been planning on using on lvl 1/slowest charging speed for my leaf once I get one, but it looks like that will only lower my chance of causing fast enough battery degradation for the warranty.

Thanks","<div class=""md""><p>This sounds pretty encouraging.</p>
