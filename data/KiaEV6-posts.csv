At the time I thought I‚Äôd get my car in November or maybe December. Instead, I took delivery of it in mid September of 2022. During that fourteen month wait, I had a chance to buy a Kia EV6 from my local dealer. Given that at the time I had no idea when Tesla might build my car, I test drove the Kia, liked it, and bought it. Now with two EVs in my garage, I have a chance to do my own back to back comparison between an Austin built Tesla Model Y Long Range and a Kia EV6 Wind with the Tech Package and AWD ‚Äî the winner stays and the other car gets sold.

When I put in my order for the Tesla, there were very few options for electric cars in Illinois with anything close to enough range for me. The Ford Mustang Mach E, Chevy Bolt, and the four Tesla models. Several EV cars from legacy car manufacturers were on the way in coming years and there might have been a few others available, just not in my state at that time. The Bolt didn‚Äôt have all wheel drive or very good DC fast charging ‚Äî later they got recalled for battery fires. The Mustang Mach E has never been particularly appealing to me and dealers were demanding extra charges for them even back then. I considered the Model 3 and Y ruling out the S and X due to price, going with the Y for the hatchback and claimed smoother ride quality.

Through the end of 2021 and first half of 2022, several additional EV options hit the US market, even in Illinois. I immediately liked the Hyundai Ioniq 5, Kia EV6, and Volkswagen ID.4 once they were officially announced. So I made inquiries at local dealerships. It came as a total shock to me when my local Kia dealer called in early February to say that they had a Kia EV6 on the lot with no reservation attached to it. This was at least five months earlier than I expected the Korean EVs to arrive in the midwestern US. I ended up buying it and at the time of this writing I have 13,000 miles on it. I think I have a pretty good sense of what the car is like to own and drive over short and longer distances in all kinds of weather.

My EV6 was my first electric car. Like most EVs, it has remarkable acceleration, a quiet drivetrain, and lots of the common electronic gizmos of modern cars. I think it is an attractive car, sporty looking and contemporary. Mine is a mid level spec for the range, a Wind with the Tech Package and AWD. So it doesn‚Äôt have a heads up display, the more advanced semi autonomous driver aids, or sunroof of the top trim model. It also has taller sidewall tires which I genuinely prefer for smoother ride quality. It has a touch screen but also has physical buttons to control various things in the car. From day one I was struck by how quiet and comfortable the car is. It is easily the quietest car I‚Äôve ever owned and among the smoothest in ride quality. Its EV driving characteristics are adjustable and I‚Äôve found a degree regenerative braking that I like. It is well built, designed, and put together. There were no flaws in the paint, bodywork, or trim. There were no squeaks or rattles when new and very few have developed in the past 13,000 miles. At the time it was eligible for the $7500 federal tax incentive making its actual cost to me less than $50,000 total.

I really like my EV6. The ventilated and heated front seats are great. I find that I use the ventilation feature often and on long drives I think it really helps maintain comfort. The layout of the controls is pretty good. I especially like that there is a little shelf below the touchscreen giving my hand a place to brace so that finger touches are more accurate even on a bumpy road. My passengers appreciate that the climate vents front and back are physical things that they can adjust at will. The rear seats are roomy and comfortable with tilting backs. There is plenty of headroom and legroom throughout the car. There are USB-C charging ports in the front and back, an interior 110 volt AC outlet, and a vehicle to load attachment to use the car‚Äôs to power port to run appliances, like for camping or in a power outage. 

Speaking of power, the car‚Äôs 77.4 kWh battery is enough to give it well over 200 miles of interstate highway range or close to 300 miles of lower speed mixed driving. It uses the CCS DC fast charging standard and mine came with 1000 kWh of free charging at Electrify America stations. If you can find the right charger and the battery is at the right temperature, the car can recharge really, really fast. But even at only 150 kWh, my charging stops on road trips are short. However, CCS is a liability at this time where I live and occasionally travel. There just aren‚Äôt enough charging stations and most of those that exist can only charge four cars at a time. I‚Äôve also found that Electrify America stations are often not fully operational, with 350 kWh equipment only putting out 125 kWh and some equipment completely non functional. I‚Äôm sure this will improve over time, but in 2022 road trips in the midwest can be extra stressful.

On September 13 of 2022 I finally had my appointment to take delivery of my Tesla Model Y. When I got to my nearest service center, I was the only customer there and my car was brought around right away. My inspection of the car found four issues, a chip in the paint, a misaligned front fender, a misaligned door, and taillights that had different gaps on the right and left. The service manager took the car in back to sort these out and I finished my paperwork. It took quite some time to fix the car but it was eventually brought back around for me to finish the set up, phone pairing, etc. But I still couldn‚Äôt leave because something went wrong with the servers and my car stayed in service mode which required another long wait while that got sorted. Lest it sound like I‚Äôm super unhappy about all of that, this was still a good buying experience and still shorter than any I‚Äôd done at a conventional dealership.

Eventually I was able to start my hour and a half trip home. The car was paired to my phone as its key. All the controls were adjusted for me. I had created a driver profile for me and a guest profile too. I‚Äôd selected some apps to go in the ‚Äúdock‚Äù area at the bottom of the screen. Saved a couple of radio presets, so time to hit the road. I‚Äôd already test driven a Model Y the previous summer, so I knew what to expect with one pedal driving. As soon as I was under way I couldn‚Äôt help but notice all the squeaks and rattles coming from the interior of the car. I made my way via surface streets and towards the interstate as the car worked on calibrating its cameras so the various systems like cruise control would start working. 

I stopped for lunch and the doors locked on their own when I walked away. That‚Äôs a nice touch and I wish my Kia had that feature. Instead I have to either fish out the key fob or firmly press the door handle in just the right way for the doors to lock ‚Äî which sometimes takes a couple of tries. Unlocking was the same easy matter on the Tesla and again better than my Kia which requires the same routine as locking it. I prefer the Tesla door handles, but both cars are ridiculous. I wish they had something more conventional. Starting the Tesla is really just getting in. My Kia has a start button and start up screen on the dash, which is fine. I‚Äôm just pointing out a difference. 

Parking and backing up my Model Y for the first time produced some more comparisons. The Tesla has better views looking out the side or front, but the Kia has better views out the back and through the mirrors. That giant Tesla screen only devotes half an inch more to its rear view camera display than the Kia EV6. The Tesla camera resolutions are no better than the various cameras on my Kia and some are worse. For example, the EV6 blind spot side cameras are much better than the Tesla. My Kia has a 360 degree surround view and multiple camera angles to aid parking. Despite its many cameras, Tesla offers less for the driver. A few years ago, Tesla may have had a huge advantage in the market, but they are being overtaken.

Finally on the interstate and pointed home, I tried the cruise control. OK, it makes needless ‚Äúboing‚Äù sounds. The computer simulation display of what‚Äôs going on around me is a neat gimmick, though I question it‚Äôs usefulness. Later, I engaged the auto steering. Yep, it keeps the car centered in the lane, just like my Kia, but it nags the driver way more. The Kia needs slight steering input less often, especially on the interstate. The Tesla seems to need something every 12 seconds but not too much or it will shut off ‚Äî it is touchy. The Tesla auto steering doesn‚Äôt like construction any more than the Kia and the visualization of the construction cones is amusing.

My drive home was around 60 miles of surface streets in two different cities, interstate between them, and a two lane rural highway for the last leg. On all of these surfaces the Tesla was noticeably louder than my Kia. Bumps hit harder and harsher which set off the various squeaks and rattles coming from all over the interior. Wind, road, and tire noise were louder and of a different character than the EV6, sharper and more echo-like probably because of the glass roof. The decibel measuring app on my phone confirms the Tesla is louder than my EV6. I set up a test later, driving the cars back to back at 60 MPH. The Tesla made 68.8 dB into the wind and 68.7 dB on the return with a tailwind. The Kia made 65.9 into the wind and 65.3 with a tailwind. 

I had six incidents on my trip home and several more since then of the cruise control or auto steering on the Tesla misbehaving. The Tesla sometimes insists the speed limit is much lower than actually is. I suspect it is reading road signs and mistaking route markers for speed limits, but no matter the cause it is irritating. The auto steering cancels sometimes for reasons I don‚Äôt understand, though I will accept that user error might be playing a role. Then there is the phantom braking‚Ä¶ in the first sixty miles it phantom braked three times for no perceptible reason and it has continued to do so nearly every time I drive it. It does this in auto steering and regular cruise control both. It actually seems worse in the day time than at night. Cresting a hill seems to be an aggravating factor. The Kia cruise control and lane centering are better. In 13,000 miles I‚Äôve had one instance of minor misbehavior in my EV6.

A thing about the Tesla cruise control that I like better than the Kia is in stop and go traffic. If the Kia comes to a stop, the driver must push a button or press the accelerator briefly to get the car moving again at which point the cruise takes over. The Tesla just goes when the car in front moves. That‚Äôs neat. Another Tesla advantage is that the auto steering and cruise control cancel together. On my EV6, they are separate systems, either one can run alone, and cancelling one does not cancel the other. I prefer the way Tesla does that because there is no circumstance where I want the auto steering without the cruise control.

The automatic high beam headlight control on the Tesla is garbage. It doesn‚Äôt want to switch to low beams, even when the oncoming traffic is really close. I had to take manual control every time to avoid blinding people on a two lane rural highway. Then it will switch to low beams for yard lights in houses I pass. I‚Äôve had or driven several cars with automatic high beam controls and all of them work much better than Tesla.

Side by side the Model Y is definitely larger than the Kia EV6. It is taller, longer, and wider. The Kia looks like a car to the Tesla‚Äôs SUV proportions. Both have comfortable seats with nice material. The Tesla heats all the seats, even the middle seat in the back. The Kia only heats the front but also ventilates them which is really nice. There is more head room in the Tesla and more room altogether in the back seat. Not that the EV6 is tight, but the Model Y does have more foot and head room in the back and more storage too. There is really no comparison in storage capacity, the Tesla has a big frunk, a big trunk, and a big area under the trunk. 

In the Model Y, so many things are in the touch screen. Climate controls including aiming the vents are in the touch screen, so are the windshield wipers, and most everything else. It is a nice screen, clear and responsive. The layout of menus is pretty good, like what one might expect from a good smartphone or tablet computer. The Tesla is very much a computer that you can drive. The Kia EV6 touch screen is much more automotive, functional but not as snazzy. Tesla‚Äôs dog mode is such a nice touch. I haven‚Äôt used it yet because I‚Äôm not letting my puppy in the Tesla unless I sell the Kia.

The smartphone app for Tesla is far better than what the Kia has. It does more. It shows more. It is better designed and most importantly it works. The Kia app has largely not worked for me three of the six months I‚Äôve owned the car. I have a service appointment to replace the modem in the hopes that improves things, but it might be a software issue instead or some kind of issue with the local cellular network. Based on my interactions with Kia over this, I can say they just aren‚Äôt a tech company in the way Tesla are.

I think the Tesla Model Y Long Range is faster than the Kia EV6 Wind. I don‚Äôt have a good means of testing that to the faction of a second, but by the seat of the pants the Tesla feels quicker. Its steering is quicker and sharper. Overall it has more of a sports car feel. My Model Y also came with the trailer hitch and modes in the software to easily turn off sensors and alarms if there is a bike rack mounted on the hitch. My Kia required an aftermarket hitch and every time it is parked each of the relevant safety systems have to be changed from the touchscreen. It is a pain, but I don‚Äôt haul my bike around all that often. 

The Tesla seems to be more efficient and over a short test of both cars back to back the Tesla got 3.64 miles/kWh or 275 Wh/mile and the Kia got 3.5 miles/kWh or 286 Wh/mile which is not a huge difference, but enough to give the Model Y more range. I‚Äôve seen averages of 4.1 or more miles/kWh (better than 250 Wh/mile) on the EV6 this summer, but I wanted to quote numbers from identical test drives. Good efficiency coupled with access to the Super Charger network and interior roominess makes the Tesla a better road trip car. There are far more Tesla fast charger stalls in the midwest than everything else combined and Tesla fixes their chargers if they break. There is a stall at an Electrify America station on a route I have used that has been broken down for months.

So which car am I going to keep and which one gets sold? I‚Äôm still evaluating, but I‚Äôll probably keep the Kia and sell the Tesla. To be sure the Model Y is a good EV and if I hadn‚Äôt had the EV6 first, I‚Äôd be satisfied with the Tesla. However, I value a quiet, comfortable ride quality and the Kia is far superior to the Tesla with its sports car ride and noisy interior. I also use cruise control a lot, most every mile I drive. The Tesla cruise control and lane keeping systems are frankly not very good. The Kia systems are good, do what I want them to do, and are trustworthy. I understand that people love the computer-that-you-drive experience of Tesla, but I prefer having real buttons and controls that I can use by feel without looking. Importantly, I can sell the Tesla for more than I paid for it and probably do so easily. 

I‚Äôve set the Model Y up with a tempered glass screen protector, all weather floor mats, a removable front plate bracket, under seat rear vent covers, and a mobile charger. Things I had researched long ago and should help keep the car in excellent condition. I‚Äôll drive it a bit but mostly it will remain parked in my garage with the battery at 50-80% until I get around to selling it once I have the title from the state, assuming I sell the Model Y and not the EV6.

Hi All,

My very plush, well-cared for 2012 F150 Platinum decided to check out and I needed a quick solution. I was caught unprepared and had not done any vehicle research (EV's or otherwise). The EV9 immediately caught my eye, but visits and calls to local dealerships were unproductive, as they currently have zero info on purchase/lease options (probably not in my budget anyway).

Long story short, I bought a 2022 EV6 FE on very short notice with minimal research. So far - WOW. Such a beautiful design and overall build quality is better than I expected from a KIA (just learning how far KIA has come in recent years). Not that I'll drive it this way much, but mashing the pedal in Sport mode is unreal. Oh yeah it also tows 2200 lbs? So cool.

### Leasing 101, thanks to [Leasehackr](https://leasehackr.com/blog/2015/9/19/8-things-you-should-know-before-leasing-a-new-car).

-	**Leasing is like paying for the depreciation** that occurs during your use of the vehicle. The monthly lease payment is calculated based on the car‚Äôs depreciation over the lease term.

-	**Some cars lease better than others.** Factors such as residual value, money factor, and cash incentives affect the lease cost. High residual value, low money factor, and generous cash incentives are desirable. You can lease an EV6 at ok price but be aware you are paying more than 8% in interest.

-	**Lease prices can be negotiated.** The selling price of a car, which affects the lease cost, is determined by individual dealers and is not set by the manufacturer. The more discount you get, the better, the lower your buyout.

-	**Be cautious of marked-up rates and fees.** Dealers can mark up the money factor, acquisition fee, and disposition fee, potentially increasing the lease cost. [Edmunds forums](https://forums.edmunds.com/discussion/69045/kia/ev6/2023-kia-ev6-lease-deals-and-purchase-prices/p2) has the latest Money Factor and Residual for all the different terms. [Leasehackr](https://leasehackr.com/rate-findr) also has a paid option to pull this data for yourself at any time. A dealer cannot change the Residual but they can markup the rate. Knowing that they are could be used as a bargaining chip to get a larger MSRP discount.

-	**When leasing, someone else (the lessor) takes on the risk of depreciation.** The automaker sets the residual value, and any overestimation is their risk, not the lessee‚Äôs.

-	**Avoid making a down payment on a lease.** If the car is totaled or stolen, you may not get your down payment back. A down payment also obscures the cost of the lease.

-	**In a lease, Kia financial owns the car.** You are just ‚Äúrenting‚Äù the car. Your insurance company pays out to the owner = Kia. Insurance company doesn‚Äôt care what you paid for the down payment.

-	**A Down payment is not DAS (due at signing).** You can have $0 down payment but still pay fees, taxes, first month payment upfront.

### What does this have to do with a Kia EV6?

-	**Kia Financial is passing through $7500 as a rebate.** This [rebate is from the feds](https://irc.bloombergtax.com/public/uscode/doc/irc/section_45w), your tax dollars. As part of the IRA bill, corporations get $7500-$40,000 in tax credits with no limits for EV and Plug-in hybrids that they put on the road. In a lease, Hyundai is the owner of the car, hence they get the rebate, they are passing it through.

-	**This has no effect on your taxes.** There is no limit, you can get as many cars as you want.

-	**Before you ever approach a dealer, know what the numbers look like.** The [Leasehackr calculator](https://leasehackr.com/calculator) is invaluable for this.

-	**Negotiate MSRP.** You should not be going in targeting a monthly payment. Lower the MSRP, the lower your buyout. As data points, multiple people have sent me sheets where they got discounts ranging from $1000-$3000 on Wind RWD. [Example here](https://forum.leasehackr.com/t/2023-kia-ev6-wind-rwd-lr-674-22mo-15k-miles-and-674-das/467186?u=kellstar)

-	**Extra Fees:** Acquisition Fee is always $650. Documents fee, some states have caps on this, others don‚Äôt. Dealer fees can vary as well.

-	**Deal sheet** would look like [this](https://i.imgur.com/D1EY6zq.jpg). Feel free to send it to me as well to take a quick look.

-	**‚ÄùAgreed upon Value of the Vehicle‚Äù** - this is a line item and should Match MSRP. I know that dealers have added $3k to this line for a third-party warranty. So keep your eyes open.

-	**‚ÄùGross Capitalized Cost‚Äù** - This will be the MSRP with any extras you add. There should be a breakdown of what this is on another page. Typically it‚Äôs MSRP+Acquisition fee+ Document fees+ dealer fees but you could also choose to pay all the extras upfront instead of adding it to the total.

-	**Cap Cost Reduction** - part of the $7500 will be taxed and the rest will go to pay for any of the extras listed above and the remainder will apply to the actual MSRP. Again this can be structured differently depending on what you are paying for upfront.


**Most importantly, don‚Äôt let a dealer rush you or pressure you to sign something you don‚Äôt understand.**

### What about trade-ins?

I get the allure of trade-ins and some states offer tax credits too. However, I implore you to take a few minutes and go through [this list](https://forum.leasehackr.com/t/list-of-places-to-sell-or-value-your-car-online/396451) with links to tons of places to sell your car. Run your car through a few of them before asking for dealers‚Äô trade-in. You would be surprised at $1000s you might be leaving on the table even after tax savings.

It‚Äôs entirely possible your dealer might match or beat these offers too.

### How do I do a buyout?

**Bad news first.**

Kia requires a dealership [to purchase the vehicle if it is garaged/registered in CO, DC, FL, HI, IN, PA, SD or SC.](https://owners.kia.com/content/owners/en/finance.html?page=finance&ssp=1&darkschemeovr=1&setlang=en-US&safesearch=moderate)



This process is going to suck in these states unless you know a good dealer. Good news is that you don‚Äôt have to use the same dealer you bought your car from.

This process sucks because you are at the mercy of the dealer and AFAIK they can charge you whatever they want within reason. I have seen insane fees of $4000-$5000 in Florida.

**Other states** - Get your Lease Buyout quote online. Send the quote to your bank or credit union. A lot of credit unions will treat this as a new car since it‚Äôs a 2023 car. YMMV however.

[Mail your payoff check to:](https://www.kiafinance.com/frequently-asked-questions?section=Payoffs%20and%20Titles)

Kia Finance America

PO Box 660891

Dallas, TX 75266-0891

Or overnight:

Kia Finance America

Box 660891

1501 North Plano Road Suite 100

Richardson, TX 75081

-	For some states the check has to be made out to HCA. Your buyout quote will have instructions on who to make the payment out to.

**Can I buyout immediately?**

Yes, you can buy out as soon as the deal is funded. Typically a week or two or as soon as you can make a Kia Financial account online.

When you do an early lease buyout, you're ending the lease and buying the car outright. Unearned rent charges(interest) are part of the lease financing and no longer apply since you're settling the lease and taking full ownership. Basically, you're paying off the remaining balance, so no more rent charges.


**LEASE BUYOUT IS NOT AN EARLY TERMINATION, THERE IS NO PENALTY FOR BUYING OUT EARLY**


**DO NOT BELIEVE ANY DEALER THAT TELLS YOU CAN ONLY BUYOUT AFTER XX MONTHS.**


**DO NOT BELIEVE ANY DEALER THAT TELLS YOU HAVE TO PAY REMAINING RENT CHARGE**

### What about taxes?

**Ok, this is complicated.**

-	For most states, you pay tax on the monthly payment.

-	Tax is levied upfront on the total lease payment for NY, MN, OH, GA. This leads to an issue of double taxation for early buyouts, at least in NY. No way around it, if you are in NY you should know what you are in for.

-	NJ has no taxes for EV but Kia/Hyundai system charges tax on the buyout. [People have explained how to fix this here with Hyundai and it should be the same procedure](https://www.reddit.com/r/Ioniq5/comments/12jx7l2/hyundai_motor_finance_lease_buyout_without_nj/)

    * For NJ buyouts, request to speak to the Escalation team. Explain to them you would like a buyout quote without sales tax and the NJ ST-4 needs to be routed to the tax team. They asked me write the dealer info as the seller. I was able to payoff my lease by using the website, but there is a 25k restriction per transaction. From /u/ay5800  

-	Tax is levied upfront on the selling price VA, MD, TX. Double taxation is an issue for TX. VA will give you credit for the taxes paid on the lease once you submit proof and then refund you after a few weeks/months. ~~Unsure of MD.~~ MD [seems to have a similar provision as VA to avoid the double tax.](https://reddit.com/r/Ioniq6/comments/12nb4e9/_/jgh0wgg/?context=1)



**Ultimately, I can‚Äôt account for each and every situation. Contact Kia Financial and your local DMV to get a definitive answer.**

- For any California residents: KMF will collect sales tax on your lease buyout, but the Bill of Sale they send to you will not include sufficient documentation for the DMV. You apparently have to call KMF and ask them to send you a Statement of Facts (REG 256) before DMV will transfer the title to you. From /u/ixdy comment [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/KiaEV6/comments/137ib78/leasing_101_or_how_to_get_a_good_deal_on_a_kia_ev6/jusq4q6/?context=3)


### Titling and Registration 

-	Unfortunately Kia Finance has a reputation for being incredibly slow when processing titles for lease buyouts

-	Expect anywhere from 60-90 days to get your title in hand. So if you are planning to flip the car or something, think again.



### Why are you doing this?

I love a good deal and I have been leasing cars for a long time. I use Reddit a lot and I have seen too many people posting misinformation with 100% confidence.

**Please please ask more questions here and I will try my best to answer. I will also add the answers to the post. You cannot have too much information here, feel free to PM me with questions as well.**

Thank you for all the information and for sharing your stories as EV6 owners.
Rest assured I'm going to put my EV6 through its paces and enjoy every minute of it!
....as a side note....that Sport Mode is ridiculously fun!!! Spent a better part of my day doing some runs on my EV6 with family and friends and they had a blast

In the process, I bid farewell to my 2019 Tesla Model 3 SR+. I'm sad to see it go but am excited for what lies ahead with my new wheels.

I've been in the world of electrified vehicles for about a decade now, starting with a regular hybrid, then a plug-in hybrid, before moving on to full BEVs with the Model 3 and now the EV6.

I'm absolutely in love with the dual motor performance and the expanded cargo volume is most welcome, as is the superior range. But a few of my friends have questioned why I didn't just change to a better-equipped Tesla such as the Model Y Long Range since that would also yield similar benefits. Thus I decided to make this write-up for anyone interested.

**What Kia does better than Tesla**:

* Physical climate controls. I'm not one of those old-men-yelling-at-clouds who hates screens - I actually *liked* how Tesla integrated the lock button, memory profiles, garage door opener, mirror adjustment settings, and headlamp settings into the screen, as their functionality is not compromised and they aren't things you'd need to touch while driving. But climate controls are another story - especially when the interface keeps getting updated in sometimes detrimental ways via OTA. The V11 update in Dec 2021 is a great example of Tesla f'ing up climate controls. I can't express enough how relieved I am to finally have temperature adjustment dials and physical buttons for my heated seats.
* Wiper controls - Not only do the automatic wipers actually work (thanks to using real rain sensors and not computer vision) - I can control them with a stalk without taking my eyes off the road. I absolutely despise Tesla wipers and continue to do so.
* Android Auto - Had a car with AA before I got the Model 3, and I missed it every day until now. While Tesla's nav system is definitely superior to others (likely including Kia's), it just isn't quite the same as Google Maps. Also, Tesla's LTE modem has an annoying habit of taking 5+ minutes to reconnect when driving out of an underground garage, making the nav half-useless until it finally reconnects. My phone, on the other hand, reconnects in milliseconds.
* Driver Assist - the HDA2 suite is essentially equivalent to Enhanced Autopilot on Tesla, while actually working properly thanks to the use of bespoke sensors rather than exclusively relying on computer vision.
* 360 camera. 'Nuff said.
* Ultrasonic sensors. Although my Model 3 had them and they worked very well, since late 2022 the Model 3 and Y have ditched them to save money and relied on a ""Tesla Vision"" replacement that's proven to be hilariously bad by numerous YouTube videos.
* Physical turn signal stalk. Again, this wasn't a problem for my Model 3 but has become a problem with the Highland refresh that will likely apply to the Model Y as well.
* A proper instrument cluster is most welcome. I didn't mind the speedometer being in the centre screen on my Tesla, but the lane-change camera was not very useful in that position. Different story when the lane change camera shows up in your line of sight.
* Build quality that makes me feel like I'm in a real luxury car. The Model 3 can't even compare to a base model Toyota Corolla on fit-and-finish.
* Ride comfort is way better - again, it feels like this car could easily wear a luxury badge and justify it.
* Interior door handles are much more intuitive. It does get tiring to explain to passengers how to open the doors from the inside.

**What Tesla does better than Kia**:

* The phone-as-a-key. It was great to not carry a fat key fob in my pocket. If the phone ever bugged out, my backup key was literally the size of a credit card!
* Tesla's mobile app is unparalleled in functionality and reliability. I could control pretty much everything short of actually driving the car. Disconnections were extremely rare (not counting no-signal situations like parking underground). It seems like pretty much every automaker other than Rivian is way behind on this front.
* Not having an on/off button makes perfect sense in a BEV. You get in, the car turns on. You park and get out, the car shuts off. There's no need for a start/stop button like in ICE cars.
* I was a huge fan of the frunk, especially in my 2019 which had these fold-out hooks to hang grocery/takeout bags. I can't even put my backpack inside the little compartment under the hood in my EV6.
* Walk-away lock was nice to have, but this is a super minor annoyance compared to what I listed above.
* It was great when the charge port closed itself as soon as I unplugged. Again, super minor.
* Sentry Mode really gave peace of mind. I am slowly rectifying this - as soon as I got home, I installed an old dash cam from before I owned the Model 3. I will need to figure out a good way to install a rear-facing dash cam as well.
* PIN to Drive was also a good peace of mind. I live in a pretty safe city and park in a secured garage, but it's always nice to have that extra layer of security if your keys ever get stolen. I don't understand why the rest of the auto industry doesn't copy this, whether EV or ICE.
* No-dealer online purchasing process. Price you see is the price you pay. I fortunately got the EV6 used with no markup but I still would rather not go through dealerships.

**Neutral**:

* While my friends often comment positively about Tesla's all-glass roof, I personally saw zero benefit as I do not look upwards when driving. My EV6 has a solid metal roof with no glass whatsoever and I am perfectly content with that.
* The gimmicks on the Tesla infotainment (video streaming, games, fart sounds, light shows, etc) added zero value for me. I do not miss them.
* I don't have a pet so I never used Dog Mode.
* Supercharging is an obvious advantage for Tesla, but I haven't used it for over a year now that I have L2 charging at home. Plus it's gradually opening up to non-Teslas.
* NACS port is obviously way better but waiting for official NACS adoption in 2025 is not to my advantage, as that means another year of my Tesla depreciating in value and Kia could raise prices in the meantime like they've already done. Dealing with adapters occasionally is well worth saving thousands of dollars.",None,None,KiaEV6,"Goodbye Model 3, hello EV6",0.97,https://www.reddit.com/r/KiaEV6/comments/190oxod/goodbye_model_3_hello_ev6/

Previously owned a 2017 Chevy Bolt and will never own an ICE ever again, even my outdoor tools are all electric. Took delivery on March 10th and have done all sorts of driving with it. From everyday around town ECO, to hard Sport mode, an 800 mile road trip to Philadelphia, regular trips up into NH and down to Cape Cod. It's been pretty cold the past 7 weeks, so I've averaged around 2.7 mi/kWh, I expect those numbers to climb as it gets warmer. 

This post isn't about the usual love for the car, to keep it short, for those who have not pulled the trigger on one, it is an amazing car, and you will not be disappointed. I have never driven in a Tesla, but it looks way meaner than a Model Y/3 and doesn't have build quality issues, and that was enough for me. My favorite moments are pulling up first to a red light and just launching the thing a mile down the road before the soccer mom next to me even gets rolling. Special shout out to all the slow left lane pick up trucks I roast on the highway too, keep rolling coal buddy, I'll stick to paying $5 to charge up my car at home. 

I've been keeping a list of things about the car that annoy me so far, be interested to hear everyone's thoughts. This won't be the usual reviewer crying about the volume knob (which takes 10 minutes to get used to), these are little things that could be fixed to make the car perfect. I'd actually love to hear other suggestions from this subreddit - I'm sure we could come up with a solid list - I might make it into a youtube video.

I'll start with things I've heard rumors about fixes incoming in the near future but weren't in the spring software update:

1. **Car color in the 3D camera display** \- it's white, my car is black, fix that up. Heard this a fair amount on here.
2. **Wireless Carplay** \- apparently the hardware is there for it, they're just going to turn it on in an update? I wouldn't mind that, but I did buy the Carlinkit Adaptor and that thing has worked flawlessly but having it built in natively would be cooler and cleaner.
3. **DC Fast Charging pre-conditioning** \- I've heard that they were supposed to add this feature so when you pull up to a 350kW charger the car could actually get you the advertised 18 minutes 10-80% charge rate. I've used a handful of Electrify America 350kW chargers so far in all sorts of conditions and it'll start at 75 then creep to 125-150 and if I'm lucky I'll see a 175. I don't think I've seen over 200 which I've heard it's more than capable of 250kW. I can give the car 10-20 minute warning that I'm about to dump a serious amount of charge into the car on a roadtrip, something that I believe Teslas are capable of. I've done an exact 10%-80% fast charge a few times and it took \~27 minutes because it was lolligagging around at 75kW preheating itself for about 7 minutes first. Give me that advertised speed!
4. **Apple CarKey** \- I've heard that the hardware is there for it, would absolutely LOVE this feature. Especially if it means I can just get in the car and drive like Tesla that'd be amazing.
5. **Kia App Support in Massachusetts** \- for those that don't know, because of a right to repair law, Kia has hard coded disabled the Kia Connect app from doing anything with the car based on my VIN where I purchased the car. *This is my single greatest gripe with the car*. For a $65k car in 2022 to not have a remote start/lock/unlock/charge app with the car is disgusting. Figure it out with the state or have a workaround in place. Let's say I lock my keys in the trunk, or want to preheat my car on a cold day from out of key range, with phone in hand, you're saying I'm SOL? In 2022? Madness. I want to confirm with someone at Kia that if I sold the car to someone in another state that this restriction would be removed. If this is the case I will sell the car to my friend in NH for $1 literally to get the app to work. If ANYONE knows a workaround or backdoor for this please let me know.
6. **Sentry Dashcam mode -** The hardware is there for it, and I even heard the Korean version of the car has a USB port to plug a hard drive into for this. I want this so bad! It should be a standard feature in all cars. I hate that I'm going to have to hardwire an ugly aftermarket camera on my windshield when the cameras and technology is right there for it. I don't need side cameras, but to be able to record the front and back views in case of any riff raff would be amazing to have.
7. **Over The Air Updates** \- Heard this one more than anything - I'm sure it's coming - Hook the car to my garage wifi and throw it in while I'm sleeping. Also is there an email list I can be notified when updates come out? Even if I have to bring it to a dealer I love me some new features, also when they implement all my changes below. :)

Here are some changes they could easily make in programming in a future update but I haven't heard too much about around this subreddit:

1. **Different Sound Profiles per drive mode** \- I'd love it if when in Sport mode I could have a different sound profile from when I'm in Eco mode. When I have passengers, I'm usually in Eco mode, a low Cyber mode would be preferred, and when I'm alone and a let's go brandon Dodge Ram pulls up next to me and I put it in Sport mode, a loud Dynamic sound profile would be sick when I absolutely roast him without even trying.
2. **Exit Number Displayed in HUD -** Above the distance to turn amount lower right hand corner on the heads up display, if they could put the exit number that would be amazing. That way I don't even have to glance at the GPS map screen to know which exact exit number/letter to take. Would make highway driving so much easier.
3. **Turn Rear Camera on when in Drive -** A few times I've had stuff piled up in the trunk so I couldn't use the rearview mirror, but I can't turn on the camera system when not a low speed. I'd love to be able to put that view on the screen for safety and awareness' sake.
4. **Chime when Autosteer disengages** \- This is a pretty important safety thing I've noticed on the highway a fair amount of times. When in HDA2 autopilot mode, sometimes you'll get to a part of the highway where the lines are damaged or faded enough where the autosteer disengages and goes from green to white. If just a little chime could alert me of this happening that'd be awesome. A few times I was cruising along and all the sudden I'm drifting more than is normal and I'll notice the car just unceremoniously stopped steering itself and the icon changing colors isn't noticeable enough an alert on its own. Doesn't have to be like the big lane keep alert sound, but just a quick small chime to tell me it's disengaged would be sweet.
5. **Autopilot prefers wrong side of the lane -** I love autopilot on the highway, it works well enough where I trust it a lot at this point and can't imagine a car without it. I do a lot of driving in the left lane and would love it if it hugged the yellow line a bit more, sometimes, especially on left corners, it will drift to the right side of the lane a bittt too close to other cars in the next lane. Obviously it never hits them, but I would feel better if it just hugged the inside line a bit better, even on straight aways too.
6. **Automatic Lane Change too hard to use** \- I've tried to use this a fair amount of times and it's just too clunky. You need to be holding the steering wheel, but somehow not put any input into the wheel or it will cancel the change? If I'm in HDA2 and it knows it's clear - just go for it, don't check the wheel and have it cancel itself by me telling it I'm holding the wheel. Sometimes I have the right touch, but it's annoying.
7. **Seat Memory not available while not in Park -** Lots of time I'll be already rolling down the driveway when I notice my seat's not perfect but it won't let me hit seat memory while in drive. I can understand if you're going highway speeds but stopped at a red light or rolling down the driveway I can't just hit the button? 
8. **NAV Keyboard not available while not in Park -** Kind of the same as previous, I can understand if you're going 20mph+, but if I'm at a red light I need to put the car fully in park to plug something into the GPS? Come on. 
9. **Both ETA and Trip Duration on Map screen** \- I know there's an option to toggle whether it shows the ETA or the time until arrival, but I wish I had both shown at the same time? Maybe just on longer drives, or maybe even show the duration until you need to take an exit on a long drive? ""In 35 minutes take exit 12"" or something, it's a little niche request but sometimes time math is hard to do.
10. **Clearer way to discern if the car is remotely started** \- Since I don't have the app to precondition, I have to go to my front window and hit the key button to start it. I find it difficult to know if I actually hit the button combo-hold correctly. Do flashing lights mean it's on? Should the parking lights stay on like the Chevy Bolt? Hell even have the lady charging voice say that the car is started, I'd be able to hear it. While you're at it, maybe a default temperature setting in the menu so I know when I hit that button what temperature and settings it will start working towards.
11. **Assign key to driving profile** \- Can I assign a specific key to a driving profile? One key for my profile, and the other for my wife? I get in and the car knows it's me because it's my key... That'd be cool.
12. **Lock when walk away** \- I've seen this parroted here, but lock the car when I walk away with the key, pretty standard stuff.
13. **Unlock when trunk opening** \- Maybe this is a safety thing, and if it is, fine, but  when I open the trunk with the trunk button or the auto-opening, I need the option to just unlock the rest of the doors. I'm holding something heavy and I use the ""stand there"" method to auto-open it, my wife is just waiting for the car to unlock because my key is buried in my pocket with my hands full. Also the day I lock the key in the trunk because the doors didn't unlock, I'm gonna be pissed.
14. **Preserve GPS Saved Locations** \- All of my saved locations in the GPS got wiped when I updated the NAV software - can there be a way to preserve those on update or offload them - I had a great saved list going until it all go wiped this week when i updated the software - super lame. Not sure I want to spend the time putting them all back in if every 6 months update will set me back to 0. 
15. **Trailer hitch shouldn't need you to cut a hole in the faring -** Kia should make a faring with the hole already in it for a cleaner look. I'm not going with the OEM hitch, waiting for the stealth hitch in a few months, but the Kia hitch shouldn't require a tech with a mitre saw to notch a hole in the underside of the car for the hitch, has to be a better way.
16. **Black emblem badges** \- I want blacked out emblem badges, let's hurry up production on those.

These two I think are 2023 model suggestions, not much I can do with my 2022:

1. **LEDs look pink not red** \- kind of takes the edge off of Sport mode. If they can fix this in software that'd be great, but it seems like they just used the wrong kind of LEDs with no good red value.
2. **Sueded seats holes debris** \- Build quality of the seats is good - but the perforations take too much attention with the vacuum to get right - I'd have to vacuum daily to keep them looking good - they just eat dirt and debris to easily and look clogged.
3. **Interior trim too glossy** \- fingerprints and dust show up instantly, and the sun's reflection of the center pieces is blinding, going to have to wrap mine to get something with a matte finish.

**Random EV thoughts:**

1. **Chargepoint only allows one home charger per account** \- I have two Chargepoint EV chargers running at 48A at my house and my cape house (bougie) and had to make a separate account for each charger? super lame. They make great chargers and the EV6 taking a huge 11kW at a time is sick.
2. **Quirk Kia in Braintree, MA is run by clowns**. Buying cars from dealerships to begin with is a joke. I will do everything in my power to quicken their demise. I could do a whole another post about their incompetence from sales to service to even their parts department. 
3. **Can't wait to have solar panels** \- Powering this beast with the sun even though my power company gives me a nighttime 9 cents/kWh rate would be the ultimate. I have a south facing hill - ground mount 16-24kw array here I come.
4. **Plans:**
   1. New Rims - the stock ones just look a bit too dopey, will keep them for winter tires though.
   2. Paint calipers - I'm thinking a deep red would go best with black?
   3. Summer tires - I bet I can get even more acceleration with the Pirelli PZ4 tires I bought.
   4. Ceramic coat - Pricey but the black car butt picks up too much dirt and the air current doesn't get it clean when it rains.
   5. Window tint - I think I did 10% everywhere but the windshield - sprang for the kind that really cuts the sun's power so the car will have to work less hard to keep it cool in the summer.
   6. Integrated Radar detector - Pricey too, but with all the nighttime highway driving I do, I want to be able to cruise without worry.
   7. Wrap shiny interior black trim - it's just too glossy - fingerprints, dust, sunlight reflections, i need something with a matte finish so it looks clean longer.
   8. Plastiip emblems - if Kia won't make em - I'll have to do it. I'm leaving the front logo and taking off the rear logo - keeping the EV6 and the GTLine badge though.
   9. Hardwired Dashcam - sad I even have to do this with 5 other cameras on the car in 2022.

**Accessories I've bought and recommend:**

**Cup holder Nalgene/Large Bottle holder:**

**Center console tray** \- this should come with the car, it's so much better than just having a hole:

**License Plate Tints** \- These are the best I've found - build quaility was better than the other ones that shattered when i put them on:

**Carlinkit Wireless Airplay** \- Works flawlessly even with my phone and my wife's phone in the car at the same time:
