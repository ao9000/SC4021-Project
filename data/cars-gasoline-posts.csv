Here's my reasoning.

&#x200B;

**Model Availability**

As we know, the era of ICE cars are probably ending soon. Many [manufacturers like Audi](https://www.roadandtrack.com/news/a35851952/audi-will-stop-developing-internal-combustion-engines/) have already discontinued R&D of new ICE drive trains. Many places [like Europe](https://www.motor1.com/news/595006/european-union-agrees-combustion-engine-ban-2035/) and [Canada](https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/canada-ban-sale-new-fuel-powered-cars-light-trucks-2035-2021-06-29/) have announced upcoming bans on the sale of new ICE vehicles. Hell, even if you don't believe that these bans will actually end up happening, [upcoming Euro 7 emissions](https://www.carbuyer.co.uk/car-ownership/303931/what-is-the-euro-7-emissions-standard) and [CAFE increases](https://www.nhtsa.gov/laws-regulations/corporate-average-fuel-economy) will make pure ICE cars harder and harder to make. At the very least, expect to see most of them turn into hybrids.

&#x200B;

This means that after the next few years, the number of ICE enthusiast cars to choose from will only go down, not up. You will still have the ability to purchase a number of very ""Old school"" enthusiast cars, like the Challenger, Camaro, BRZ, Cadillac Blackwings, on the performance side, and cars like the LC500 on the more grand touring side.

&#x200B;

Many ""enthusiast"" traits like natural aspiration, manual transmission, pure ICE, etc will be disappearing soon, and they won't be coming back. This is essentially your LAST CHANCE to buy them.

&#x200B;

**Truncated depreciation curve**

Traditionally speaking, cars depreciation steeply when bought, eventually reach ""beater"" status, stay there for many years, and as their numbers dwindle, their prices will go back up. For most cars, their values would stay very low for many, many years until it starts climbing up again.

&#x200B;

However, remember how ICE enthusiast cars will be disappearing? One of the biggest contributors to depreciation is the constant progress of technology. New cars are better, thus they exert downward pressure on used car prices. New cars also add to the ""pool"" of acceptable cars, thus reducing the value of existing used cars.

&#x200B;

For instance, imagine if you want a naturally aspirated V8 coupe. There's probably hundreds of thousands of them out on the road today, and a steady drip of new ones coming from dealerships. However, once that stream of new naturally aspirated v8 coupes stop, the only ones left will be the existing ones. Every time one falls apart and gets junked, or gets wrecked in an accident, the total number remaining will only go down.

&#x200B;

This means that whereas previously, you can buy a new enthusiast car, and watch its value depreciate to a very low point, and only begin to climb back up 20 years later. If you buy an enthusiast car today, it will never depreciation to too low a low point, and its value will start climbing back up relatively quickly.

&#x200B;

**Good availability and incentives.**

Before Covid, getting manufacturer incentives on most cars was relatively easy. Hence the joke that Ford will give you a $10 thousand dollar discount on an F150 the moment you walk into the dealership.

&#x200B;

Covid changed all that, instead of discounts and incentives, we ended up with wait lists and markups due to a shortage in supply. Most analysts believe that the market will return to normal end of this year to next year, although the ""perma-glut"" of previous years probably won't be returning.

&#x200B;

As enthusiast ICE cars slowly get phased out in 2025+, a problem you will probably see is the ""final edition problem"". Consider for instance, the Acura NSX. The car sold terribly every single year, and at points had 5 figure incentives on it constantly. However, for the last model year, Acura decided to restrict production, and call it the ""final edition"", [which very quickly sold out](https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/acura-nsx-type-s-sold/). 

&#x200B;

Demand typically spikes and automakers routinely restrict production when a car is about to be discontinued, especially if there is no successor. I anticipate that this phenomenon is going to be massive post 2025, when gasoline cars in general are disappearing. 

&#x200B;

Cons i can think of placing battery under the interior floor:
- difficult cooling design
- less interior space
- prone to being damaged from underneath
- need stronger structural frame (since it’s “wider”)
- if battery is too long to save headroom space, it will increase wheelbase, so it would be difficult to design a “compact” car

Pros i can think of placing battery under the interior floor:
- better handling
(but if it’s lightweight than inverters or motors, will it have that much benefit like today EV?)

- easy to swap / replace battery pack or cells

Edit 2: u/FecalKing did a deeper read through than most and noted an important error. I used the energy conversation factor rather than the unit conversation factor for coal and gas while calculating gasoline equivalence. This over inflated the energy content of those fuel, which over inflated the milage. The mpg numbers have been updated but the emission numbers are unaffected by this change. **Updates are bold**

Edit 3: check out this link if you want some professional analysis, instead of the armchair engineering that follows. Thanks to u/sfo2 for the link. https://blog.ucsusa.org/dave-reichmuth/new-data-show-electric-vehicles-continue-to-get-cleaner

When people ask about my electric car, I often get the comment “Well, electric cars technically get their power from coal power plants, so actually my gas car/truck is better for the environment! Gotcha!”

Technically these people are not wrong about some electricity coming from coal, but they are also not well versed in advanced thermodynamics as is related to industrial scale power generation, as well as the variety of power generation methods used in the US. Note: All following info is for the US; international results may vary.

In my experience, people have a hard time conceptually with the massive efficiency increase between a small, variable RPM car motor, and a full size power plant. A lot of very smart people have spent a lot of time and made a lot of money by optimizing power plants into the modern engineering marvels we have (and take for granted) today.

To help deal with this annoying conversation, I ran some numbers. Let’s go on a journey of math and learning!

Extraction:

There are lots of emissions associated with getting gas/coal out of the ground and refined to a usable state. For ease of conversation here, let’s assume that the emissions associated with pulling stuff out of the ground, transporting it to a refinery, refining it, and transporting it to the gas station/power plant are the same and call it a wash.

Gas cars:

The EPA mandates that new cars and trucks (as of 2016) have a fleet average fuel efficiency of 35.5 mpg and emit no more than 250 grams CO2 per mile (https://nepis.epa.gov/Exe/ZyPDF.cgi/P100EZ7C.PDF?Dockey=P100EZ7C.PDF). This is the baseline we will be comparing against. Some cars will be higher or lower depending on age and specific application, but as we will see this doesn’t really matter to us.

Electric cars:

I have a 1st gen Nissan Leaf, and my average efficiency over the last 50k miles has been 4.0 miles/kWh. I like empirical data and things will probably get more efficient in the future, so let’s go with that.

Turning dead dinosaurs into physical movement:

Gasoline has an energy content of 33.7 kWh/gallon (https://afdc.energy.gov/fuels/fuel_comparison_chart.pdf). Unfortunately, we have some losses when it comes to converting gasoline’s (or any other fuels) chemical energy into kinetic energy.

The main fossil fuels for electricity in the US are coal and natural gas (methane).  The US Energy Information Administration publishes the following energy contents for those two fuels. Don’t worry too much about the units, we’ll normalize all of this to gasoline pretty soon.

Coal: 9,544 btu/lbm

Natural Gas: 1,034 btu/ft^3

https://www.eia.gov/electricity/annual/html/epa_07_03.html

In addition to the energy content of the fuel, we also need to take into account the amount of electricity that can be recovered from said fuel. There are billions of dollars of research committed to making these numbers as good as physical possible. It is easy to just gloss over them, but this is the real crux of the argument.

Coal: 10,465 btu/kWh

Natural Gas: 7,812 btu/kWh

https://www.eia.gov/electricity/annual/html/epa_08_01.html

The last piece of the puzzle is emission. Greenhouse gasses and their effect on our climate are real, but complicated. For ease of conversation, we are just going to look at CO2. If you don’t like that, fight me. Once again, the EIA uses your taxes to publish some great data.

Coal: 93.3 kg CO2/Million btu

Natural Gas:  53.1 kg CO2/Million btu

https://www.eia.gov/electricity/annual/html/epa_a_03.html

These energy numbers are all well and good, but there has to be some loss in all those power lines, right? The loss varies based on how far away from the plant you are, but in the US it is between about 3% and 10%. Let’s use 10%.

http://insideenergy.org/2015/11/06/lost-in-transmission-how-much-electricity-disappears-between-a-power-plant-and-your-plug/

With that, we have enough data to calculate how your electric car is ruining the planet! Let’s do it! We are looking for miles/gallon and grams/mile, so let’s do some unit conversion.

Coal – gasoline equivalence:

(9544btu/1lbm)(**1kWh/3412btu**)(1gal/33.7kWh)= **0.083** gallons of gasoline equivalent per pound of coal.

Coal – mileage:

(9544btu/1lbm)(1kWh/10465btu)(1lbm/**0.083gal**)(4miles/kwh)(10% line loss)= **40 mpg.** Not bad for coal!

Coal – emissions

(1kWh/4miles)(10465btu/1kWh)(1Mbtu/1000000btu)(93kg/1Mbtu)(1000g/1kg)= 243 grams/mile. Hmm… not great.

Natural Gas – gasoline equivalence:

(1034btu/1ft^3)(1kWh/**3412btu**)(1gal/33.7kWh)= **0.0089** gallons of gasoline equivalent per cubic foot of natural gas.

Natural Gas – mileage:

(1034btu/1lbm)(1kWh/7812btu)(1lbm/**0.0089gal**)(4miles/kwh)(10% line loss)= **53.5 mpg**

Natural Gas – emissions

(1kWh/4miles)(7812btu/1kWh)(1Mbtu/1000000btu)(53kg/1Mbtu)(1000g/1kg)= 103 grams/mile. Nice.

So a “purely coal powered” electric car has similar emissions to the EPA standards (it would fail as a car but pass as a light truck), but also gets 40 mpg... Damn good for the states.

A “natural gas only” electric car gets about 53 mpg but emits well under half of normal car emissions. A pretty strong nail in the “electric cars are dirty” coffin, and some (industry) analysis done in Germany is a nice reality check on our work: https://www.wingas.com/fileadmin/Wingas/WINGAS-Studien/Energieversorgung_und_Energiewende_en.pdf 

“But wait! Doesn’t the US get its power from a variety of sources?” you say? Well yes, it does. About 36% from natural gas, 28% from coal, 19% from nuclear, and 17% from various renewables (http://insideenergy.org/2015/11/06/lost-in-transmission-how-much-electricity-disappears-between-a-power-plant-and-your-plug/). CO2 emissions and gasoline equivalents from nuclear and renewable are small enough to disregard in this analysis (citation needed). So in reality, an average electric car charged in the US would look like this:

Mileage:

(0.35x53.5mpg)(0.28x40mpg)(0.19x inf)(0.17x inf)= **75 mpg**

Emissions:

(0.35x243g/mi)(0.28x103g/mi)(0.19x0g/mi)(0.17x0g/mi)= 104 grams/mile

TL;DR

Unless your car gets **75 mpg** and emissions 2.5 times lower than EPA standards, an electric car is still better for the environment. This will only improve as the US moves away from coal and more towards more economical sources like natural gas and renewables. 

Or just put some solar panels on your roof and bathe in your own smug-ness as you get infinite mpg and 0 emissions.

Bonus fact!

Gasoline and diesel fuels are not actually stable, and have a limited shelf life. Due to the extremely complicated extraction/production/distribution networks required to put gasoline in your car, all the “preppers” in the audience should REALLY be excited about electric vehicles and rooftop solar.

You might be wondering, how does a 2009 mk1 focus exist, or why someone would want to convert it to run on gas. well most importantly of all, I'm argentinian. here we get cars for longer because we are poor, and we have stupid amounts of import taxes. so the cars have to be made here, and once they get the factories up and running, they have to stretch the car's life (the renault clio 2 was sold here for 20+ years). To help clear americans of confusion. Whenever I say ""gas"" I do not mean gasoline. I'm talking about the compressed natural gas that this car now runs on

[Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/Nh8fVD8.png)

The system is called ""GNC"" (gas natural comprimido) or compressed natural gas in english. the tank goes in the trunk. this one can hold 14 cubic meters of compressed gas. it gets about 180km of range. wich is not a problem at all. because here in argentina this is a REALLY common modification. basically every single petrol station has gnc pumps. some of them even have more of them than actual gasoline pumps. Why do people do this to their cars? well, gasoline is expensive here, and gas is 60% cheaper. so you save A LOT of money on fuel, sacrificing only half your trunk and a bit of power (we'll talk about that later)

[Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/iGERzt6.png)

that weird thing that I took a picture off is the gas gauge. It gives you a bit of info on the system. there are 5 lights at the bottom, those just tell you how much gas you have left, and there is one at the top. when the car is running on gasoline it will be red, and green when it starts using gas. the system is really easy to operate. you basically don't have to do anything weird. when you first start the car it will run on normal gasoline, the light will be red. when the engine gets to normal operating temperature, it will turn green. gasoline supply will be cut off, and gas will start being injected. when this happens the car will be running exclusively on gas. no gasoline at all, but, you can switch to straight gasoline anytime you want by pressing the button in the middle

[Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/iGG6SRT.png)

This is an electronic valve, it's there for safety, if it detects any leaks it will automatically cut off the supply and sound an alarm

[Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/SgMKMlf.png)

The blue thing gets fed gas by that pipe, and it reduces pressure to the one desired

[Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/7o53OZd.png)

Whole system is electronicaly controlled, it has it's own computer and everything. here you can see the relays that switch off the injectors, on top of the valve cover, but below them is how the gas gets into the engine, it has it's own injector ramp, that goes into the engine through the intake. here's a pick of it stock so you can see the difference

[Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/n4R8UUy.png)

The biggest problem with this system, is that gas is less volatile than normal gasoline. so the car will make less power. about 5-10% less in this kind of engine. but I didn't need more than 100hp anyways. Now that I have this system. I can move around extremely cheaply, it really is a LOT cheaper than normal gasoline. and I can fill up in 90% of petrol stations. If I ever need more power, I can just switch back to gasoline, with the press of a button and the car will run exactly the same as stock

BP is the 4th largest gas station chain in the United States (by number of locations according to this site https://www.scrapehero.com/location-reports/10-largest-gas-stations-in-the-usa/ ) and is the most popular gas station in states in the Midwest (Wisconsin, Illinois, Iowa, Ohio).  Speedway (3,313 locations compared to BPs 6,718) is also not Top Tier rated and is the most popular gas station in Minnesota and Indiana. 

When I bought my Accord in 2018, I had done some research on what gas to use, as it was my first turbocharged engine and first direct injected engine. Prior to this, I had always thought all gas was generally the same. But, per my internet research, there seemed to be actual benefits to using Top Tier gas in direct injected engines. (See this older article from Consumer Reports https://www.consumerreports.org/fuel-economy-efficiency/top-tier-gasoline-worth-the-extra-price-a7682471234/?EXTKEY=AFLIP .) 

Back in 2018, I know BP was on the Top Tier list (I don't think Speedway ever was?), but hadn't checked that list since. Since it seems like every other gas station near me in the Midwest is a BP, I generally went there. So I was surprised earlier this week finding out they were no longer Top Tier. Using the wayback machine, it looks like BP was removed from the Top Tier list sometime in October/November 2021 (listed in October 2021,  https://web.archive.org/web/20210619052435/https://www.toptiergas.com/licensed-brands/ removed November 2021, https://web.archive.org/web/20211129022027/https://toptiergas.com/licensed-brands/) . 

This isn't meant as an attack on BP. I'm only posting because now because I'm a little more sensitive to the gas I put in my current car (Stinger) and want to make sure I don't have any issues with the direct injected engine (I don't think the  3.3L TTV6 in the Stinger has as many complaints as other, smaller engines from Hyundai/Kia).

It got me wondering what real advantage diesels have in passenger car and truck use. I understand for over the road trucks the slightly better mpg, and longevity of a diesel engine are what matters. But no F150 or car is going to be used as long or for the same purpose as a semi.

So the specs are: 3.0L, 250 HP, 440 TQ, 30 MPG hwy. Along with a $2,400 (3.5 Ecoboost) to $4,000 (2.7L Ecoboost) up charge over other F150 engines.

Then there's the Ecoboost engines. You have the 2.7L 325 HP/400 TQ 26 MPG hwy. 3.5L 375-450 HP/470-510 TQ 25 MPG hwy. There's also a 3.0L ecoboost but it's used in cars. It makes 400/400. I assume with tuning for a truck it would make less hp and more tq. 

All of the mpg specs are for the tallest rear end ratio in a 2wd truck.

So the diesel gets a few mpg better on the highway, Slightly higher torque per displacement at a slightly lower rpm. Yet it is at a huge disadvantage in horsepower, and costs significantly more. It takes more expensive fuel and regular maintenance is more expensive.

I just don't see the benefit of getting the diesel option. Does the slight torque advantage really overcome a huge horsepower disparity in towing situations compared to the 2.7L? Even at that the 2.7L is a smaller engine. The 3.5L trounces the diesel in everything but mpg.

I got my driving licence and bought my first car some months ago. It is a used, 2009 Mazda 2 1349cc 75PS 5-door hatchback. I have been reading and researching on how to maintain my car, try to make it last and maximize my gas mileage (basically to save money) - As a general rule, everyone says one should run the engine on as low RPM (highest gear) as possible *without* *lugging the engine*.

This is the one thing that I do not totally understand, what counts as lugging the engine? such as, at what RPM range specifically? Obviously that depends on the car and there is no official answer to find.

 What are the signs of too low RPM and lugging? Some say I should hear some horrible, unmistakeable noise or stuttering or vibration similar to stalling, but that never happened to me. I tried specifically googling and searching for this but I can't find anything specific, some even say that the engine can lug without showing any signs at all.

Some information on my driving habit so far:

the Engine idles at \~700 RPM. I shift up at 2000 RPM, and unless I feel that I need more power for something like uphill, I normally shift down at \~1000 RPM. Sometimes when braking for a stop I let it go to \~1000 before pressing the clutch, or often in a 30 kph zone I let the car cruise at 3rd gear (30 kph is \~1500 RPM at 3rd gear), naturally slows down and keeps rolling at idle RPM to turn (\~15-20 kph), then slowly accelerate back up a little bit, does this constitute as lugging the engine?

When I drive, I always only lightly press the throttle and never floor it - since I usually drive in the city/suburb, there are always traffic lights; and to save gas. The city I live in is very flat (Rhein river valley), giving gas lightly even at 4/5th gear is usually enough to maintain speed or even gradually accelerate on flat roads at above 1000 RPM. Since I had no need to accelerate like in a drag race, I never experimented what happens if I floor the gas at this RPM with these gears.

But here is a question - sometimes I can hear a low pitch humming sound (mmhmm hmmm) after shifting up and when RPM is still climbing/accelerating, the sound is more audible (not very loud) at high gear, such as between 1000-1500 rpm at 5th gear, but it may also happen for 0.5-1s at low RPM when I shifted from 1st to 2nd gear, is that a sound cue of lugging?

Is there any test I can do to understand my car better? like...driving up an incline and putting on a higher gear and flooring it to see if it struggles to accelerate??
