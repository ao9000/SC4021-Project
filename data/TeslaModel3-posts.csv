This was my second EV after a little Chevy Bolt which I liked. My car was the Goldilocks of Model 3 LFP, it had the performance motor, USS, and matrix headlights from the earlier production run in 2021. I put about 20,000 from commuting and some road trips to the mountains. 

**Things I Liked**

* Not waiting for oil to warm up, or engines to start. You can just hop in and go and not worry about punching it. 
* The app works well to heat or cool down the car before hopping in
* Autopilot works decently now for highway use. The phantom breaking from a year or so ago is gone. 
* Storage is pretty good with the sub trunk, flat floor inside the cabin, frunk etc.
* Phone key is great being able to just walk up or walk away. 
* Regen and one petal driving is super easy to commute in. 

**Things I disliked**

* Build quality is just like how everyone says. Some of my panels were a bit gapped, which I don‚Äôt care about really, but the rear doors never closed well.
* The rear defroster never worked from day one, and required a week long service, where they replaced the rear glass with the wrong part, extending the repair further
* Buying process wasn't the best. I lost a $250 deposit due to some bad info from the local sales person, and also was refused supercharging referral miles I had expected to get. 
* Front glass is extremely thin. I had one windshield replaced and a second crack repair. The Safelite guy said he worked on Teslas constantly.
* I despise the all glass roof. It adds almost nothing in terms of openness for the front occupants, but lets in tons and tons of heat. It‚Äôs the worst of both worlds. 
* UI is response, sure, but being completely touch screen based is bad no matter how you shake it. 
* Lack of CarPlay. I want multiple mapping options and better music support that CarPlay offers. 
* Driving experience is meh. You can tell Tesla is a company focused on tech and automation, not a spirited driving experience. The main culprit is the traction control, which cuts in constantly to kill any sort of fun. It would cut power on a straight on ramp I take every morning due to a small bump. This is never a car I‚Äôd want to take down a twisty back road. 


Overall, I decided to sell it and get a fun to drive manual transmission before they‚Äôre gone for good. Manuals connect you to the car and offer a huge grin factor. It‚Äôs also great to have CarPlay back. I also figured we‚Äôll all be driving EVs for the coming decades, it may be my last chance to row my own gears and have fun on a back road. 

My last point is about this Tesla Subreddit. I‚Äôm not quite sure why, but i found it to be one of the least helpful, and most toxic car sub I‚Äôve used. Snarky comments, lack of community, frankly idiotic questions about damage or insurance etc. I just found it to be in stark contrast to other car subreddits where people were cordial and enthusiastic about others in the community.

Get excited about most cars. Fast cars, weird cars, rare cars, JDM, muscle, euro, ultralux, the list goes on and on. 

There‚Äôs a million different places to celebrate and talk about your cars with people. I‚Äôm in a goofy subreddit for my Honda passport. The mom car for dads. I‚Äôm in a subreddit for my corvette. Even in a forum for landyacht appreciation. 

In all of these places there‚Äôs different ways to celebrate or commune. Wrangler community loves their ducks, hybrids show off their hyper miling and share tips, and a lot of these communities have this unspoken fun game they play where if you see your car out in the wild you park next to it. It‚Äôs like a fun ‚Äúnice car man! I‚Äôve got one too!‚Äù.

I love my Tesla Model 3. It‚Äôs so cool, powerful, unique, fun. I‚Äôve been eyeing them since before I made anywhere near as much as I make these days. 

You guys however; the community, it‚Äôs owners/drivers. You guys are the pitbull owners of car groups. The parents with kids at a restaurant. 

I‚Äôve never had a less welcoming and fun community surrounding a car. I‚Äôm in a subreddit FOR HONDA PASSPORTS for crying out loud. 

Every comment I‚Äôve posted has been hit with sarcasm, harassment, passive aggression. My two posts have been beaten into the ground and shit on in the comments. One was asking for advice, the other was just an appreciation post since I saw another Tesla in the wild (we have none out where I live). 

In my lifetime of car collecting and car shows, you guys are truly the worst people I‚Äôve ever met. 

I‚Äôm sorry it‚Äôs a blanket statement, it can‚Äôt be true for everybody. It‚Äôs true for my experience so far however. 

I love my Model 3, but some of y‚Äôall disgust me.

EDIT add; a small portion of these comments are a prime example üòÖ

EDIT 2; loving that the upvotes are outweighing the negative comments and downvotes. Glad I‚Äôm not alone.

EDIT 3; because my account is being doxxed I‚Äôm going to block now lol. Deleting comments of mine in this post to avoid the trolls lol.

EDIT 4; sorry about the pitbull owners and kids at a restaurant joke. Probably should‚Äôve been clear lol. (Owned a pitbull for 12yrs and have a daughter myself.)
Turning off notifications for this post because it has a longer lifespan than my attention span. 

It‚Äôs good to know the good people outweigh the bad, they‚Äôre just not as loud as the bad are in this sub. 

Thanks for the support y‚Äôall. If it makes you feel less nihilistic/more positive about the Tesla community; my posts upvote to downvote ratio as of 1600EST was 86% of people agree, 14% disagree.
