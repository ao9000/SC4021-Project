As you would imagine just like anywhere else, people parking their gas vehicles at the only 2 stations is a common occurrence. 

I have brought up the issue to the front office multiple times in the past and they always tell me they’re working on resolving the issue. 

Nothing ever gets done. And most times they just ignored my emails, so I gave up and just started thinking of it as a privilege that’s not owed to me since it’s free. 

But I just can’t get over the fact people park their gas vehicles there despite the sign that says “EV CHARGING ONLY”. These people are inconsiderate and park there because they know it’s not enforced. It’s disrespectful.

This expanded agreement with Tesla holds the potential to transform the landscape of universal EV chargers throughout the continent, providing your hotels with a competitive advantage by offering guests overnight charging access.

This process will be managed in phases, allowing time for final market selection and site evaluation.

Yesterday I went to a new brand of charger.  It was about an hour before dusk.   I had to scan.  Download the app.   Fill out crazy amount of information.  This particular charger didn’t use Apple Pay, so I had to go to into my car and sit there to enter my credit card info.  

This entire time, about five minutes, I am at a convenience store in a place I am not familiar with.  The chargers are off the side of the building not in view of the front door.  

People are passing me and staring at my car as I am trying to just start charging.

I am in an area of the US where  fast chargers are few and far between, and EVs are still somewhat a novelty (I am the only one  that I know that owns one -even counting Teslas).

EV Charger Plug fire - be careful! (Input requested. Link to pics below). 

Dodged a full house fire last night. Outlet completely melted. Fire burned casing and wall, but went out on its own. 

Equipment:
- Siemens versicharge 240/30A plugged into a NEMA 6-50 in a drive under garage. 
- Dedicated line with 40A fuse
- Professionally installed during home construction.  

Events:
- Charged friends MS 100D for 8 hrs during the day
- Charger rested for 1.5 hrs
- Plugged in a MS 75 to top off for the evening
- MS charged for a few hours then breaker tripped

Next morning I go out to find this near catastrophe. 

Very scary. Melted box, all wood is charred. 

Curious if I need to replace the entire wire (which is run through about 50 feet of walls in my house). 

I read that EV chargers should be hardwired to avoid fault points like a plug. 

Also read that most NEMA plugs aren’t intended to handle current for long periods of time (designed for a few hours running a dryer). 

Electricians coming tomorrow. 

Welcome any comments about how to protect myself in the repair/ reinstallation. 

I’m likely going to hardwire the charger (no plug) and look into adding a temperature sensor or something - and definitely a fire sensor.

The fires start in the power terminal blocks, where the power and charging cables connect to the PC board. It appears that the screws holding the terminals to the block are either loose or cross threaded, such that the terminals are not making solid contact with the power block. The result is that the terminal block and the PC board experience high heat, resulting in melting and smoke. PCB smoke is very nasty and potentially toxic to breathe.

My recommendation is that if you have a Grizzl-E unit, disconnect it from power, open the unit, and verify that all of the power block screws are very tight. If you are not comfortable doing this yourself, have an electrician perform the work.

As of the end of Q3 2023, the 30 charging “networks” operating in the USA have activated 33,415 chargers supporting either CCS or Tesla connectors across 6,346 stations.

During this decade the number of places to plug-in for DCFC has more than doubled, while the number of chargers has more than tripled.

CCS networks have deployed 11,846 chargers across 4,400 stations. Tesla though still dominates, having deployed 21,569 chargers across 1,946 stations, reflecting the fact that their stations are on average much larger.

(So far, the number of Tesla stations that support CCS remains insignificant, at 11. According to their data, 10 of them were enabled back in 2022. While recent media reports suggest that Tesla has very recently converted more stations, they have not yet reported them to NREL. See the “Data Notes” section at the end of this post.)

&#x200B;

**Competitive Landscape**

Although we now have 30 DCFC “networks” operating the USA, the industry remains quite concentrated. Just seven companies operate 92 percent of DCFCs and 96 percent of the stations. Of course, the dominant player in the market is Tesla, with 65 percent of the DCFCs and 31 percent of the stations.

Both Tesla and ChargePoint are pushing ahead. In fact, over the past four quarters, ChargePoint added more stations than Tesla, making it the second largest network in the USA.

Electrify America fell to number three in terms of stations, falling behind ChargePoint as its own growth slowed at the same time that ChargePoint's accelerated. eVgo is gaining on Electrify America but still holds the number four position, followed by Shell Recharge, FCN, and EV Connect.

When counting chargers - a proxy for vehicle capacity - we get a different picture of the leaders. While ChargePoint is rolling out a lot of stations most of them support a single car. As a result, Electrify America continues its wide lead in CCS chargers, with their stations having a median size of 4 chargers each. Of course Tesla dominates due to their comparatively large stations, having a median size of 8 chargers each.

**Newcomers and Laggards**

Newcomers to the market over the past year: Rivian Adventure, 7 Charge Up (aka, 7-Eleven), and Circle K. While there are other newcomers - ChargeUp, Revel, Livingston - at this point in time it is hard to describe them as true “networks” when they have only one or two stations each.

On the other hand, growth from the FCN, EVCS, and ZEFNET networks have plateaued over the past three years.

**Are stations getting bigger?**

In a word, somewhat - if we are talking about CCS stations. The overwhelming majority of stations have four or fewer chargers. However we are seeing some improvements. Electrify America now has 59 stations with eight or more chargers; eVgo has 26 with eight or more chargers. 

Meanwhile, Tesla continues to upsize. They have 1,792 stations with 8 or more chargers and 339 with 16 or more chargers. Their biggest is - very big - with 84 chargers, opened on August 31.

**Data Notes**

Data source: My data comes from a public database of ""alternative fuel stations” hosted by the US Department of Energy’s National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL). It’s accessible via an API and is documented [here](https://developer.nrel.gov/docs/transportation/alt-fuel-stations-v1/all/). 

Note that the aggregate numbers captured by NREL database do not always exactly match those published by the EV networks on their own websites. Why? Beats me. For example, Electrify America seems to be quite slow with updating the total station and charger numbers reported on their own web site and the numbers alway differ from what they report to NREL on a regular basis.

I make a distinction between places to charge - a s*tation -* and DC Fast charges at a station. Counting stations is a bit of challenge because the companies are inconsistent in how they upload records to the NREL database. Some data records represent a single physical location and indicate the number of chargers at that address. Other records though might represent a single charger, with one record for each charger at the same address. Ideally I could simply roll up these addresses to form stations, except common location records do not always share the same representation of the street address. Example: “71 East Grove St” vs. “71 East Grove Stree” vs. “71 East Grove Street”. Therefore I have to do some address standardization before aggregating.

Finally, I do not count CHAdeMO chargers since this technology is being phased out, or “non-networked” stations because most people would not use them on a regular basis. Typically these are car dealerships and/or are not accessible after business hours.

When I got back to my car I noticed a Hyundai parked beside me with the charging port open.
I instinctively plugged the cable back into the charging housing to end the session, unplugged it and then plugged in the Hyundai before driving off. It just made so much sense to me that this person would leave their port open and I hope I made their day when returning to their car.

Has this happened to anyone? Is this standard practice? I can set my charging port to auto unlock when fully charged.

And it was charging slowly (~4kW) compared to what was advertised. After some research I downloaded the installer app to and set it to 50A. It started charging faster (9.1-9.3kW). It was working fine for multiple days/charges, but then suddenly stopped. I shut down the breaker, unplugged it, and opened up the panel to find it had melted/burned. What could have happened? 

I’m 99% sure that I set it to 50A not 60A, I’m 100% sure that I set it to ‘Plug-In’, not ‘Hardwired’. Looking at the ChargePoint product details, there isn’t even an option for Hardwired and 60A. Would the app even have let me select those together? I can’t check the settings I used without connecting to the charger, and that’s not happening anymore.

We have been discussing adding EV charging to one of our Charleston Station since the EV charging situation is terrible here. We were initially going to get a couple of 25kW units and call it a day but after doing some research we found that those probably wouldn't be the best solution since most EV's now have 75+ kWh packs. 

Our goal is to be able to provide at least 2 200kW to 350kW charging stations and up to 8 total if there is a system out there that provides some kind of load balancing, for instance 1mW site power shared between 8 chargers would allow a full station to charge at 125kW per car or half capacity to charge at 250kW per car. Again I am unsure if a system like that even exists other than the networks like Electrify America and EVgo but it would be a major plus so that we could offer more charging stalls.

The first site that is a good candidate does have 3 phase power and the grid transformer for the power is located very close to where the chargers would potentially go. We've talked with a few electricians although both told us that the tech didn't exist yet and probably wouldn't for the next 5 to 10 years and if it did it would probably cost millions to deploy, None the less we are still interested in finding a solution even if it's a few years out.

Any info on this would be great.

Even just a standard level 1 charger could maintain battery temp and add a decent amount of range on nightly basis. Everyone needs to sleep and we should vote to build AC charging for as much overnight charging as possible.

It takes into account

* Battery pack size (it's currently set to the Ioniq 5 large battery pack size)
* mi/kWh efficiency for ""miles added"" estimation
* Charging losses due to different levels of charging (20% for L1, 10% for L2)

And it calculates

* Percentage added per hour, in 12 hours, and in 14 hours
* Time needed to add 50 miles, 30%, 50%, 70% and 90%
