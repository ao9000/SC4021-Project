Some background: The roads in NZ are maintained by using a portion of money from the ""National Land Transport Fund"". This Fund (NLTP) gets its money from a few different sources, including:  	

1. Fuel Excise Duty 	        (FET) 	
2. Road User Charges	(RUC) 	
3. Vehicle & Driver Registration & Licensing 	
4. Road Tolling   

FET is paid by people who drive petrol cars, it is a charge they add on to the petrol price: it costs 70.024c per litre. (As a side note, the government taxes you on this FET so it actually costs 80.5276c, but this extra does not go to the NLTP so I will not count it).  

RUC is paid by Diesel Vehicles (since they don't pay FET) and now also EVs.   

The cost of a RUC is based on distance travelled, so you will have to buy a 1000km pre-pay card/license to display on your windshield for $76. You can buy multiple of 1000km, so if you want you can get 10,000km in one go. There will be an additional charge of $12.44 per transaction.  

So, if you buy a RUC License for 10,000km, you will pay $772.44 (76\*10 + 12.44). With this RUC License, if you commute 50 km per day, this will cost you $3.86 in RUC fees.    

Let's compare this to a 2010 Toyota Corolla with a fuel efficiency of 7.4L/100km. This vehicle can cover 50km by using 3.7L of petrol, so by comparison the FET this vehicle will pay to travel the same distance will be only $2.59. The EV is paying \~1.5x more to the NLTP for driving the same distance.   

Now imagine you have a more modern petrol car, with even greater efficiency, you will pay even less to the NLTP.  Another way to look at it (if we stick to the 10,000km RUC License example) would be to think of the EV as an ICE Vehicle with an efficiency of 11.03L/100km. Because that is the efficiency of the engine you'd need to be paying the same $3.86 in FET fees.  

The average age of the NZ light vehicle fleet is roughly 15 years. This means the 2010 Toyota Corolla represents the average fuel consumption of NZ vehicles,    
Why then is the RUC for EVs set to equivalent to vehicles which consume 11L/100km? It makes no sense.   

&#x200B;

TLDR:  EV Road User Charges are overpriced, even when you buy in  bulk it's the equivalent of a petrol car with the fuel efficiency of a tank (11L/100km).    
They should be priced lower to match the NZ average fuel consumption. ",None,None,EV RUC Costs Compared to ICE Vehicle Fuel Excise Tax: Unfair.,0.82,https://www.reddit.com/r/nzev/comments/19f38yp/ev_ruc_costs_compared_to_ice_vehicle_fuel_excise/

Just to clarify it was a BP charger, the car was at 82% when unplugged, we were keeping an eye on the app hence us going back out to see what was going on and no we didn’t see or confront the other driver as we had no idea if this was kosher or not.

A tourist here who's been traveling around the South Island in an EV for the last week. I've driven over 1000 km including Aoraki National Park, Queenstown, Dunedin, and Christchurch. First off, wanted to say thank you to a few folks who pointed out some key tips for me as I planned my EV trip, especially getting a ChargeNet RFID FOB in advance.

So, this may run contrary to many opinions here, but in my experience, NZ has the best EV charging network. I essentially lost any sense of range anxiety after a day or two. It felt like every 30-50 km, there was a ChargeNet L3 station that I could generally depend on. I rarely saw a station down in the entire island on the ChargeNet app. There were two spots where I had to wait a few minutes for someone else's car to finish, but everyone was very diligent about moving their vehicles once finished.

In the future, the main limitation I can see are queues for the stations as more people transition to EVs. So increasing the number of stations in a location will probably be key. But in my admittedly limited experience, NZ has made it by far the easiest and more comfortable for EV travel. I've driven EVs extensively in a couple of other countries of differing degrees of modernization (U.S. and Sri Lanka), and I've unsuccessfully tried to plan EV trips in some (Australia and Japan). NZ takes the cake above all of those!

Here's the differences I noticed from my 2022 Model 3

● Quieter
● More comfortable, suspension is great. The way it handles speed bumps is a massive improvement.  Doesn't jolt you. 
● Handling is even better, steering is sharper, sport handling seems lighter. 
● Blind spot light is bright enough but looks a little rubbish IMO. Would have been cool as a T
● Cooled seat were nice, wish it would be stronger on the back rather than bottom. My back needed more cooling than my nuts. 
● Because the cabin is quieter it seems like the air conditioning system is louder now or more noticeable even on low.
● Door thud is solid and sounds more European. 
● Using the screen to put it into drive and reverse was great and didn't have me missing the gear selector. The indicators are a bit weird.

I really like the rear, looks great and the fact it has two power struts is better.
Not the biggest fan of the front. Maybe it'll grow on me.

The way it is now, quieter and more comfortable and refined is the way I always imagined and hoped my M3 was going to be like from the start.

For the last 5-6 years, I’ve been powering my house directly from my tired old 55% SoH 2011 Leaf via a 12V inverter during power cuts. With the recent disruptions, this topic has been coming up a lot and I’ve gotten a few questions from people asking how they can do this.

[Pictures of the setup [here](https://imgur.com/gallery/itcHjr6)]

This is a rough guide for how to get started sorting something like this out for yourself. Obviously, if you have a vehicle that has Vehicle-to-Load capability, that’s a much better way to approach it. For the rest of us, a 12V inverter is a cheap and easy option.

**Inverter:**

The main item needed is the inverter itself. I would strongly recommend sticking to ‘pure sine’ inverters which cost a little bit more but are far less likely to cause problems with the appliances you’ll be connecting. For the Leaf, the most you can reliably draw from the 12V system is around 100A or roughly 1.2kW so there’s no need to go for anything too large. A voltmeter on the inverter is also helpful, but not strictly necessary. Mine is a 2.5kW unit from AliExpress that cost around $200. I chose one this large because I was skeptical of the ratings and wanted a bit of safety factor to avoid overloading it, but after using it for a while I don’t think this was necessary.

For reference, the LED lights, fridge/freezer, chest freezer, home networking setup and a pair of laptops draw less than 400W. The water pump draws another 300W but has significant start-up current, so huge numbers aren’t necessary if you’re only looking to keep a fridge running and the lights on.

Some inverter options are listed below, but I don’t have any personal experience with them. Hopefully other people can chime in with what they’re using.

[jaycar.co.nz](https://www.jaycar.co.nz/3000-watt-12vdc-to-240vac-pure-sine-wave-inverter/p/MI5744)

**Connecting to the vehicle:**

The next step is connecting the inverter to the vehicle. This will usually depend on what came with the inverter and how much power you think you’ll be using. A smaller inverter might be ok with alligator clips but anything more than a few hundred W will benefit from being bolted directly to the battery terminals. This is something that you’ll likely need to figure out how to do, but in my case there was enough thread left over on the bolts to be able to add the terminals under the existing nuts. Connect the wires to the inverter first and then onto the terminals of the battery to lessen the chance of shorting anything and causing some sparks to fly. If you do get a bit of a spark when the cables first touch then that’s just capacitors charging, no big issue. Connect it with the red/+ terminal to the + on the battery and the black/- terminal to the – on the battery, as usual.

For convenience, I’m using a 175A Anderson PowerPole connector to allow me to easily connect and disconnect the inverter from the car. If you have the capability to solder or crimp large gauge terminals then this can be a cheap and relatively easy quality of life upgrade, but it is by no means required. If this isn’t something you can do, a local electrician or auto-electrician should be able to help out and, if they’re friendly, may allow payment in beer.
I’m also using a 150A fuse in a holder in line with the positive lead from the battery but, if I were doing this again, I would omit this in future to make things simpler. I don’t think this fuse would blow from anything other than an extreme short circuit so I don’t think I’m actually protecting anything with this, realistically speaking. Mine is a leftover from an old car audio setup, so if you’d like to use one for peace of mind, anywhere that deals with car audio should have something usable.

(Edit: A plug-in power meter is also an ultra useful thing to add to the setup. It'll show you how much power you're actually drawing out of your inverter, which can help estimate how long the battery in the car will last etc.)

Another useful item to have around is a multimeter. A DC current clamp meter can also be useful to see how much you’re actually drawing from the car, but it isn’t required.

**Operating the setup:**

Once the inverter is connected to the car, the car will need to be placed into ‘ready to drive’ mode, or any other mode that has the vehicle powering the 12V system in the car directly from the much larger traction battery. In the Leaf, this is done by pressing a foot on the brake, pushing the power button and then watching to see the little green car icon with arrows under it appear. Other cars will have different approaches which may require some googling or assistance from people who are familiar with them. I would turn off anything in the car that may draw power. No fan or climate control, no headlights, etc.

(Edit: It's VERY important to note that in this condition, the car can easily be put into drive and moved. I don't have kids or pets to worry about, but I'd strongly recommend making sure that the vehicle is secured away from anyone who may not understand what's going on. The Leaf can be locked using the key hidden in the fob, if needed.)

With the vehicle in ‘ready to drive’ mode, if your inverter has a volt-meter showing the incoming voltage, it should show somewhere between 12.8V and 14.4V. This can also be checked with a multimeter. As long as the voltage stays somewhere in this range, the car is supplying the power from the main vehicle battery.

At this point, the inverter can be turned on and things can be connected as desired. To start with, I used a lot of long extension cables and multi-way boards. The total power is limited to whatever the inverter can supply, so it’s very unlikely that you’ll be able to do anything to overload even the most convoluted spiderwebs of cables and multi-boards. As with anything like this, keep a close eye on stuff to make sure nothing gets partially unplugged, gets hot or starts to smell funny, etc.
A vastly better approach to this is if you have wiring for an external power source connected via a changeover switch, which is my current solution. Having an electrician make this modification is likely beyond where most people will go, but is useful if you find yourself in this situation often. With this setup, a custom lead can be used to provide power from the inverter into the main house wiring, with the changeover switch isolating the house from the mains so that this can be done safely. Some care will be needed to switch everything off to start with and only turn back on the things that are absolutely necessary to avoid overloading the inverter, but other than that this is the simplest approach to actually use.
From this point, it’s simply a case of using it! The car will have no issue staying on for long periods of time. If the inverter gets overloaded just disconnect some items, turn the inverter off and then back on, then start connecting things back up until it’s happy again.

**Other thoughts:**

The main downside to this is that managing the whole process is very manual and it can only supply low power loads. It won’t really be able to be used for cooking, boiling water, keeping a hot water cylinder going. I wouldn’t personally leave it running overnight, but that’s up to the individual. You’ll also need to monitor the vehicle yourself to make sure it doesn’t run too flat and turn itself off or be unable to make it to a charging location.
The upside is that it’s a cheap and reliable way to keep low power things running, keeping the fridge and freezer cold and keeping yourself in contact with the wider world.
I’ve currently been without power for 2 days and have had the Leaf powering our house during the day for most of it. Our hot water cylinder has stayed warm enough to allow for normal temperature showers. I’ve charged the Leaf at a fast charger twice during this process and during the day at work once, but a car with a better/larger battery could likely have lasted the entire way through, as we only really get 4-5kWh out of the vehicle between only charging it to 80% at the fast charger and then the distance to get from the charger to home and then back again once it’s flat.
Hopefully this will encourage people to give this a shot themselves. 

**Edit 1:**

In terms of figuring out how much power you can draw, the easiest approach is to use a voltage display on the inverter or to use a multimeter to look at the voltage on the 12V battery. As long as it's staying at or above 12.8V, things are probably fine.
A lot of people struggle estimating how much power something will take, but the easiest approach is to look at what it says on the back and use some logic. A laptop charger might be 40-60W. A phone charger might be 5-10W. A desktop PC could be anything from 50W to 500W. A fridge/freezer is likely 100-300W. LED lights are usually 5-15W.
Add that all up and that's what you get to. In my case, 4x12W LED bulbs, 150W fridge, 150W freezer, 50W laptop, 50W of networking gear and cameras etc = ~400W.
It's also unlikely that you'll hurt anything doing this. If you overload the system, the inverter will likely just turn off when it sees the input voltage drop. Just restart everything and start adding stuff back!

**Edit 2:**

Also, the plug-in power meters are a great way to keep an eye on things. I'd STRONGLY encourage using one with this setup.",None,None,Emergency Power from an EV,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/nzev/comments/1151yf5/emergency_power_from_an_ev/

I went from a 2018 $21k ICE Golf to a 2018 $19.5k Leaf 40G leaf. 77km on golf, 49km / 89% on leaf. 

Driving / practicality  
The ICE car handled better and has a nicer cabin but the instant torque of the leaf and effortless driving around town means that for 90% of our driving, I prefer the Leaf. Features wise, they were line ball – the Golf had a better screen and digital dash and more premium feel, the Leaf has 360 camera but a shit screen. Both have adaptive cruise, blind spot monitor, small army of airbags etc. Leaf has a much bigger boot which is a huge plus. Range and battery degradation the biggest downside for the Leaf but given its our second car, that doesn’t matter for us.   


Economics 

Golf running costs: 7% cost of capital (interest on mortgage as proxy) on $21k = $1.5k; Depreciation = $3k; Insurance $1k; petrol for 13,000 km $3k and service / rego $700. Total annual cost = $9.1k  

Leaf: Cost of capital: 0 as I got a 5 year interest free loan. Depreciation $3k, Insurance $1.2k, service and rego $300 (generous – I doubt it needs annual servicing). Electricity for 13,000 km $400 but I have 3 hours free each night which makes this pretty much free. Total annual cost: $4.5k.  

For the loan, it’s with Westpac. I had given them robust feedback that every bank apart from them offered an EV loan! Terms are 5 years, interest free, up to $50k, invoice from dealer required. 

So, by making the swap we save nearly $5k per annum.  For me an absolute no brainer. RUCS will trim potentially up to $1k of that.",None,None,Recent switch to EV. My numbers,0.92,https://www.reddit.com/r/nzev/comments/1556r5h/recent_switch_to_ev_my_numbers/
