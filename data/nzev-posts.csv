Some background: The roads in NZ are maintained by using a portion of money from the ""National Land Transport Fund"". This Fund (NLTP) gets its money from a few different sources, including:  	

1. Fuel Excise Duty 	        (FET) 	
2. Road User Charges	(RUC) 	
3. Vehicle & Driver Registration & Licensing 	
4. Road Tolling   

FET is paid by people who drive petrol cars, it is a charge they add on to the petrol price: it costs 70.024c per litre. (As a side note, the government taxes you on this FET so it actually costs 80.5276c, but this extra does not go to the NLTP so I will not count it).  

RUC is paid by Diesel Vehicles (since they don't pay FET) and now also EVs.   

The cost of a RUC is based on distance travelled, so you will have to buy a 1000km pre-pay card/license to display on your windshield for $76. You can buy multiple of 1000km, so if you want you can get 10,000km in one go. There will be an additional charge of $12.44 per transaction.  

So, if you buy a RUC License for 10,000km, you will pay $772.44 (76\*10 + 12.44). With this RUC License, if you commute 50 km per day, this will cost you $3.86 in RUC fees.    

Let's compare this to a 2010 Toyota Corolla with a fuel efficiency of 7.4L/100km. This vehicle can cover 50km by using 3.7L of petrol, so by comparison the FET this vehicle will pay to travel the same distance will be only $2.59. The EV is paying \~1.5x more to the NLTP for driving the same distance.   

Now imagine you have a more modern petrol car, with even greater efficiency, you will pay even less to the NLTP.  Another way to look at it (if we stick to the 10,000km RUC License example) would be to think of the EV as an ICE Vehicle with an efficiency of 11.03L/100km. Because that is the efficiency of the engine you'd need to be paying the same $3.86 in FET fees.  

The average age of the NZ light vehicle fleet is roughly 15 years. This means the 2010 Toyota Corolla represents the average fuel consumption of NZ vehicles,    
Why then is the RUC for EVs set to equivalent to vehicles which consume 11L/100km? It makes no sense.   

&#x200B;

TLDR:  EV Road User Charges are overpriced, even when you buy in  bulk it's the equivalent of a petrol car with the fuel efficiency of a tank (11L/100km).    
They should be priced lower to match the NZ average fuel consumption. ",None,None,nzev,EV RUC Costs Compared to ICE Vehicle Fuel Excise Tax: Unfair.,0.82,https://www.reddit.com/r/nzev/comments/19f38yp/ev_ruc_costs_compared_to_ice_vehicle_fuel_excise/

A tourist here who's been traveling around the South Island in an EV for the last week. I've driven over 1000 km including Aoraki National Park, Queenstown, Dunedin, and Christchurch. First off, wanted to say thank you to a few folks who pointed out some key tips for me as I planned my EV trip, especially getting a ChargeNet RFID FOB in advance.

So, this may run contrary to many opinions here, but in my experience, NZ has the best EV charging network. I essentially lost any sense of range anxiety after a day or two. It felt like every 30-50 km, there was a ChargeNet L3 station that I could generally depend on. I rarely saw a station down in the entire island on the ChargeNet app. There were two spots where I had to wait a few minutes for someone else's car to finish, but everyone was very diligent about moving their vehicles once finished.

In the future, the main limitation I can see are queues for the stations as more people transition to EVs. So increasing the number of stations in a location will probably be key. But in my admittedly limited experience, NZ has made it by far the easiest and more comfortable for EV travel. I've driven EVs extensively in a couple of other countries of differing degrees of modernization (U.S. and Sri Lanka), and I've unsuccessfully tried to plan EV trips in some (Australia and Japan). NZ takes the cake above all of those!

Here's the differences I noticed from my 2022 Model 3

● Quieter
● More comfortable, suspension is great. The way it handles speed bumps is a massive improvement.  Doesn't jolt you. 
● Handling is even better, steering is sharper, sport handling seems lighter. 
● Blind spot light is bright enough but looks a little rubbish IMO. Would have been cool as a T
● Cooled seat were nice, wish it would be stronger on the back rather than bottom. My back needed more cooling than my nuts. 
● Because the cabin is quieter it seems like the air conditioning system is louder now or more noticeable even on low.
● Door thud is solid and sounds more European. 
● Using the screen to put it into drive and reverse was great and didn't have me missing the gear selector. The indicators are a bit weird.

I really like the rear, looks great and the fact it has two power struts is better.
Not the biggest fan of the front. Maybe it'll grow on me.

I went from a 2018 $21k ICE Golf to a 2018 $19.5k Leaf 40G leaf. 77km on golf, 49km / 89% on leaf. 

Driving / practicality  
The ICE car handled better and has a nicer cabin but the instant torque of the leaf and effortless driving around town means that for 90% of our driving, I prefer the Leaf. Features wise, they were line ball – the Golf had a better screen and digital dash and more premium feel, the Leaf has 360 camera but a shit screen. Both have adaptive cruise, blind spot monitor, small army of airbags etc. Leaf has a much bigger boot which is a huge plus. Range and battery degradation the biggest downside for the Leaf but given its our second car, that doesn’t matter for us.   


Economics 

Golf running costs: 7% cost of capital (interest on mortgage as proxy) on $21k = $1.5k; Depreciation = $3k; Insurance $1k; petrol for 13,000 km $3k and service / rego $700. Total annual cost = $9.1k  

Leaf: Cost of capital: 0 as I got a 5 year interest free loan. Depreciation $3k, Insurance $1.2k, service and rego $300 (generous – I doubt it needs annual servicing). Electricity for 13,000 km $400 but I have 3 hours free each night which makes this pretty much free. Total annual cost: $4.5k.  

For the loan, it’s with Westpac. I had given them robust feedback that every bank apart from them offered an EV loan! Terms are 5 years, interest free, up to $50k, invoice from dealer required. 

So, by making the swap we save nearly $5k per annum.  For me an absolute no brainer. RUCS will trim potentially up to $1k of that.",None,None,nzev,Recent switch to EV. My numbers,0.92,https://www.reddit.com/r/nzev/comments/1556r5h/recent_switch_to_ev_my_numbers/
