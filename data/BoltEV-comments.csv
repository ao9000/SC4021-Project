breeves001,"I like this. As a Mach E and Rivian owner it is so frustrating when you pull up to one of the shared EV Go stations and a Bolt or Nero EV (Nero drivers are the worst offenders) are charging at this one with the other two available.

Of course if those two are full they have every right to use the faster charger.

I’ve asked people (politely) to move before or just use the other one and explain exactly what this sign is saying to them.

technicalskeptic,"lol, big city problem.  This makes me want to park my bolt there at 5% charge and charge the thing to 100%.  


Unfortunately where I travel alot ( I-40 ) rural arkansas and oklahoma, we don't get the luxury of multiple charging stations > 2 and they are far apart.  


Once the Tesla network opens up, I think alot of these issues will go away.  


The ONLY DC CCS station in Conway arkansas is a 24K station and the next nearest to it going north is 199 miles way.  For my bolt to get home from there, it must have 83% with a 10% buffer.  Heading from the west the next closest station is a EA station in Clarksville, about 120 miles away, so my car is usually around 15% when arriving in Conway.

But after 15 tries and about a half our I got the only “working” station to connect and charge.  
Stats for the trip:  
3,188 miles  
22 DCFC charges  
3 overnight L2 hotel charges  
$215.22 spent on charging  
676.54 kWh of paid charging  
\+ \~200 kWh of ‘free’ hotel charging  
Most expensive place to charge: Boonville, MO at $0.39 / kWh w/ tax  
Least expensive place to charge: Troy, IL Chargepoint DCFC at just $1.50 per hour!

I met some nice folks on the way including one guy who was driving his F150 lightning back and forth across the country. The Southwest was of course the best part for scenery and a few sites along the way.

[deleted],When they throw in something free in finance it’s usually to confuse real management and to get a commission or it’s because it’s preinstalled. . That’s why I always tell the dealer I want to pay this much bottom line with taxes and I don’t care how you write up the top line invoice. I once got a fully loaded Corolla for $18k….finance guy and dealer gave themselves a $1000 doc fee. Didn’t care as I saved $4k,"<div class=""md""><p>When they throw in something free in finance it’s usually to confuse real management and to get a commission or it’s because it’s preinstalled. .

Please forgive me asking, what factors went in to going with the Bolt?  I expect to buy an EV in the next few years, but 99.9% sure it will be a Tesla.  Not trying to hate here, looking to educate myself, sincerely, why did you choose a Bolt over say a Model 3 or Y which are getting very affordable, with price drops and incentives I know I could get a model 3 for about 30k.

The battery manufacturing and disposal pretty much displace any ""green"" initiative offset by not consuming fossil fuels, arguably also displacing gasoline with electricity being generated by other forms of non-carbon ""neutral"" fuels.

Yes, I own a new Bolt.  I am also quite conservative. I bought it because I enjoy their utility and generally low-maintenace lifespan. It's actually my 2nd EV. I would have purchased a Tesla if I could afford it because I like the tech. But Chevy had a vehicle (EV) that no other manufacturer could compete with at this price point, especially combined with the federal incentive. 

Will I take the government incentive?  Hell yes.  Why not?  If it wasn't available, I would have simply purchased a used ICE vehicle.  Is it the government's job to help me buy one or help manufacturers sell them?  Absolutely not. 

Since the thread is somewhat political, I'd remind everyone that Trump has stated that he would never try to stop people from buying EVs. It's personal preference. Buy an EV, or buy an ICE vehicle.

Just stop being butt hurt that you might not get some of that Govt welfare. Also realize Bolts are already being sold way below the cost of manufacture.

Lord_Vesuvius2020,I’m concerned that US automakers except for Tesla will soon be between a rock and a hard place. They will still have to support ICE but also create competitive EVs at the same time. The strategy of only producing very expensive cars will fail in a few years and especially as the 18 CARB states begin sliding EV mandated quotas for new car sales starting with the 2026 model year. If the federal government repeals the tax credits it will only hasten this decline. In the meantime China is making huge strides in EVs. IMHO what I think will happen is that Toyota will buy a Chinese EV manufacturer and rebrand those cars for import into the US market.,"<div class=""md""><p>I’m concerned that US automakers except for Tesla will soon be between a rock and a hard place.

Now for the ICE it has its downfalls as well, maintenance cost to up keep them going, having to buy fuel and terrible in town driving and short commutes. It’s not only bad on efficiency but it’s hard on them because they don’t get up to normal temperatures with the proper amount of thermal cycles to alleviate moisture, which then causes issues with rot and drivability issues. Together though these two compliment each others downfall’s and makes a very good reliable, efficient car. That’s why I own a Volt:)</p>

mcmonopolist,"Wow. Part of me is stoked to get a new battery on my 2020, but I am also discouraged to see 100,000 newish batteries potentially having to go to waste.

Does anyone have any info on what they'll do with the batteries? I would hope they can test the cells and put them back to use somehow since the vast majority of cells should not have the defect.

Striking_Artist_6429,"Oof so I have a 2017 I bought last May.  It had like 22,000 miles on it.  I've done many road trips in the last year.   2 road trips of over 2,800 miles during the summer month that consisted of nothing but DCFC charging.  I now have 64,755 miles on my Bolt. Yes I have driven her hard for the past year. If I get a new battery with more range I will be ecstatic. I love our Bolt,  the kids love the backseat as they sit higher than the front and they can see the road better. It's quite spacious and the trunk holds enough crap for the road trip for 2 weeks for 5 people.  I can't see having to get rid of my Bolt.

Huskertex,"Here are the reasons I am beyond pissed:

1) It’s a Chevy. After all the constant repairs I watched my parents endure growing up while being loyal to GM through the early 80s and finally buying Nissan and Honda’s that drove reliably (what a concept!) I never ever ever ever was planning to buy GM. No matter what. This was seared in my mind from childhood. Utterly and completely. I took a leap of faith because “It’s not a Chevy, it’s an LG battery on wheels”

2) GM brings the Bolt to market. I think, how cool! GM is trying. I won’t buy one, but neat. I get a job 2 miles from home. What do I need? I need an EV. Two miles to work will kill my ICE truck that is 20 years old. By now the Bolt has been on the market for 3 years. I heard about the fires, but was promised I am safe because these batteries were made in  Michigan. It’s really a battery on wheels GM’s past be damned. 

3) The utter and complete disregard for the consumer. Guess what I have not one, but two level 2 charging stations. (I know I am spoiled, 1 is a detached garage). Neither of these will work outside. The cable doesn’t reach that far!

4) The 20 year old truck I dispensed of and replaced with the Bolt HAD NOTHING WRONG WITH IT. It was a Toyota’s second year of production for the first gen Tundra. Now I get car payments, triple the insurance rates, and this fucking car may spontaneously combust from GM.","<div class=""md""><p>Here are the reasons I am beyond pissed:</p>

DropKnowledge69,"It looks good. I'm interested in V2H option (which I believe the Denali version has) so that it'll be a mega powerwall for my home.  I already have a Tesla solar power system with 2 powerwalls. At $8K+ for a single powerwall with 14kwh capacity, these huge trucks with huge 100+ kWh battery packs are actually a decent deal if you consider how much it'll cost to get the same capacity in multiple powerwalls.

In short, a less costly mega battery storage system with 4 wheels.  I think this is a big reason that Tesla doesn't offer V2H on it's cars ... because it'll eat into it's powerwall sales.","<div class=""md""><p>It looks good.

jimschoice,"We thought the Bolt would be ok for us, and we made it work for 3 years. But it was too narrow, and those tiny seats were just awful. 
I’m glad GM bought ours back and we were able to get a Lyriq for not a whole lot more after tax credit and state rebate, and the $1,000 for the SuperCruise delay.   I won’t know how much of the $7,500 credit we get to use until next year, so won’t know my final total cost of the car until then. I’m estimating $5,500 of the  $7,500 based on last year. 

The Lyriq is a little bit too long. 
Maybe we’ll keep it long term, or maybe something else will lure us into trading it in a few years. 

It is 25% less efficient than the Bolt too. 
But, much much more comfortable.  And charges so much faster at DCFC stations. 

We miss the excellent air conditioning of the Bolt, the nice metal roof, and the rear underfloor storage.   Oh, and Normal door handles that have buttons to LOCK the doors with a simple touch.   And the HOME and AWAY charge settings.

bbf_bbf,"I'm not surprised they've killed the Bolt.  It was always going to be a ""limited run"" because GM has clearly shown that the ""Ultium"" platform was the way forward with their BEVs years ago.  Now that the Ultium platform vehicles are rolling out, there's no need to keep on manufacturing the Bolt.   Also Bolts are manufactured in the US, that's EXPENSIVE compared to its replacement, the Equinox EV, which is manufactured in Mexico.

Also, there's not a large market in the US for small hatchbacks and add to that the fact that average consumers also expect small cars to cost a lot less than larger cars (eventhough in real life, the labor involved with manufacturing one is about the same and the difference in material costs for an extra 12"" of car is only a few hundred dollars at most) manufacturers that have to show their stockholders the largest ""profit margin per vehicle"" possible so their stock doesn't tank, don't like making low margin vehicles.

I'm more surprised that they killed the Volt since there's no replacement in GM's line up and there obviously is a lot of consumer demand for plug in hybrids going by how many other manufacturers have hybridized their ICEV line up.  Sure it's an interim step in electrifying vehicles, but it's still a very valid segment at the moment.","<div class=""md""><p>I&#39;m not surprised they&#39;ve killed the Bolt.

Aragorn3223,"I have a 2022 EUV and wasn't terribly surprised by the news, considering the upcoming Equinox that was announced. If that truly sells for about $30K and has similar, if not better, range and tech, then it's not as bad as the doom-and-gloom folks claim. Granted, $30 IS higher than $27, but there are potential advantages to the ultium platform in the newer car over the current Bolt battery design. 

Either way, until they get EVs down to sub $25K levels (and have them with ranges of around 250 miles at LEAST) then widespread adoption will not happen. 

There ARE some other options that we will have (in the near-term(ish)) such as:

1. Fisker Pear - $30K start
2. Chevy Equinox - $30K start
3. Aptera - $26K start

Granted, none of these three are for sale yet, but they are expected either later this year or the next. Based on the momentum building around EV production, it wouldn't surprise me if at least the Equinox becomes the top affordable EV to own by this time in 2024.","<div class=""md""><p>I have a 2022 EUV and wasn&#39;t terribly surprised by the news, considering the upcoming Equinox that was announced.

AllTheWine05,"The Volt/Bolt was a testbed/prototype for the upcoming BlazEr/Equinox/TahoE EV SUV products. They never wanted the Bolt to be a long-term product. Ford proved that the ""no more sedans/coupes/hatches"" is a viable strategy and most of the market is going that way.

My guesses:

First, Chevy wasn't going gangbusters with the gen1 Bolt because they didn't yet have the production or market for it yet. Parts like e-motors and battery trays require new production and inspection equipment. I know because I sell some of that equipment, and this is all new to manufacturers.

Then, as Chevy got good at producing EV drivetrains and battery units, they updated, advertised, and sold the shit out of Bolts. They cannot keep up with orders right now. The fact that people are struggling to acquire one is great news for them but it's not like they're holding back. Production is capped because of equipment.

Finally, they never wanted to continue building sedans/hatchbacks. They stopped years ago with the exceptions of EVs/PEVs and the Corvette/Camaro. So when they could, they cancelled the Bolt as soon as they could transition to producing the BlazEr/Equinox/TahoE they always wanted to.

The Bolt proved they could build large numbers of EVs and battery/drivetrain technology could handle SUV duty. I hate all of this too sinceI generally don't like SUVs. Like it or not the market (not just Ford and Chevy) is and was going that way anyway. It's going to get worse too, since Chevy has already announced that the C8 Vette will be the last gas Vette and they also said they're going to pimp out the nameplate for VetteSUV's and other shit too (like Ford did with the Mustang Mach-E). 

Anyway, as a Bolt owner, this is likely good news for resale values at least through 2026 or so.","<div class=""md""><p>The Volt/Bolt was a testbed/prototype for the upcoming BlazEr/Equinox/TahoE EV SUV products.

[deleted],"Tint all the windows! Not only does it make the car look better, but I've found that it really helps keep the cabin more comfortable. That's really true of most any car, but the extra help is useful with an EV. In SoCal, I'm averaging about 11% HV battery consumption to climate control. It would be even higher without the tint; since having mine installed, I'm finding that I'm just as comfortable with the AC on auto at anywhere from 2-5°F higher than in my Tahoe.

Sport Mode is fun. Especially to turn on while accelerating onto the freeway :)

I don't have Super Cruise, but ACC is amazing on freeways, especially in heavy traffic. It's also quite smart about using regenerative braking, as is at least as efficient as I am on manual.

One pedal driving is similarly amazing, but only in town (and other stop-and-go situations--not freeway-style slow-and-go). Works exactly like compression braking on a manual transmission. Paired with the regen-on-demand paddle, you don't ever need the brake pedal after a bit of practice. 

When computing range and how far you can go, just look at the minimum number that the car gives you. Don't push it, because running out of power is a lot more cumbersome than running out of gas with an ICE.","<div class=""md""><p>Tint all the windows!

SultanOfSwave,"ABC. Always be charging. So when you get home just make it a habit to plug in. That way you always have a ""full tank"".

Sign up for two or three of the charging networks in your area and keep your credit card on file with each of them. Using an app to control charging sessions is the easiest way to manage them.

You also may want to watch some YouTube videos on how to use the high speed chargers with your EV. Unlike with gas pumps, you normally plug the cable into the car first before authorizing the charging session. The car and the charger will ""talk"" to each other while you are authorizing the charging session. 

Download both Plugshare and ABetterRoutePlanner (ABRP) onto your phone.

Plugshare is crowdsourced information on chargers with pictures, reviews and ratings. They often have nearly realtime info on whether the stations are operational or not.

ABRP is excellent for planning longer trips that automatically route you with charging stops.

Lastly, cold weather and wind can dramatically screw with your range. Always have backup charging stops in mind when you are driving in the winter. RV parks are a good emergency backup but you'll need a TT30 (120v, 30 amp) and a Nema 14-50 (240v 50 amps) to get a faster charge. Also call ahead. Some RV parks are reluctant to allow EVs to charge as they stress their electrical systems.

PatStPete,"Nice installation, but I think you may find that you need storage. The panels will put out  24\*760W = 8880w = 8.88KW, on a bright day with a perpendicular sun. That would give you 38 amp service at 230V, which is enough for the Clipper Creek 32 amp, but not their faster one. Winter will be worse with the lower sun angle. So, even on optimal conditions, you will still be drawing from the grid for household load. Maybe put in storage and charge at night to even the load? Or slow charge the Bolt?  Still, congrats on the system.","<div class=""md""><p>Nice installation, but I think you may find that you need storage.

You can say that again: the Cybertruck is aimed at the segment of the market who are on crack, while the Bolt appeals to those who are not on crack.

Just because Musk was on crack while he designed and developed the Cybertruck, that doesn't mean that anyone who's on crack would like it.","<div class=""md""><p>&quot;both vehicles represent entirely different ends of the market and are polar opposites&quot;</p>

[deleted],"Everything I have read about the process of disassembling the battery and replacing the modules suggests that it is highly-skilled and precise work, including torquing multiple bus connectors precisely.

I've heard an estimate of 8 hours of labor per car: open battery, replace modules, re-torque a ton of connections, re-balance cells, refill coolant, test, re-seal the pack, test again - where any error can result in later failure. Wow.

Do we have confidence that GM can train enough dealer techs in a reasonable timeframe, and that we can trust them to execute this swap properly?

These techs are going to be doing exacting work usually performed by specialists in a factory - specialists who do this all day.

jaharmi,"Are there any “safe” J1772 extension cords? 

The listings at Amazon and elsewhere don’t give me great confidence; they have the look of cheap knock-offs under multiple brand names. Many of the brands are in all caps.

The ones I’m seeing all seem to be labeled/rebranded Duosida. I simply know nothing about them.

The weather/waterproof ratings also differ. I’ve seen IP54, IP65, and IP66.

On the plus side, a Lectron one (may also be rebranded Duosida, based on a review) claims “superconductivity.” :face_with_tears_of_joy:

Googling for it, Duosida claims its equipment is UL certified and IP66. It may be, I found a UL listing (below). With the variability in the sale listings, I’d simply like to verify all this first. It’s possible these extension cords could be the best 40A extension cords ever.

<p>The listings at Amazon and elsewhere don’t give me great confidence; they have the look of cheap knock-offs under multiple brand names. Many of the brands are in all caps.</p>

<p>The ones I’m seeing all seem to be labeled/rebranded Duosida. I simply know nothing about them.</p>

<p>The weather/waterproof ratings also differ. I’ve seen IP54, IP65, and IP66.</p>

<p>On the plus side, a Lectron one (may also be rebranded Duosida, based on a review) claims “superconductivity.” :face_with_tears_of_joy:</p>

<p>Googling for it, Duosida claims its equipment is UL certified and IP66. It may be, I found a UL listing (below). With the variability in the sale listings, I’d simply like to verify all this first. It’s possible these extension cords could be the best 40A extension cords ever.</p>

dborn62,"I have a question concerning the ""safe"" charging/parking behaviour:

I understand that GM is intentionally (or unintentionally?) keeping the instructions vague to limit their liability:

""**Continue to park your vehicle outside immediately after charging and do not leave your vehicle charging indoors overnight**.""

Now, if you use your car every day and you need to charge every day, the point is moot.

But, if you don't use it much (due to Covid) and therefore do not need to charge it more than once during the week, am I being foolish in thinking that if I recharge it outside and keep it at 85% (lowest level to get the automatic diagnosis during 4h) that if I wait for 24h after the *charging* is completed, it will be safe (enough) to bring it back in the garage until the next time I drive it more than 10km and need recharging?

Is the rule above meant to say ""never park it inside, under any circumstance except for charging if you have no choice"" or ""take it outside immediately after charging if you must charge it inside"". How long is the danger for? I don't think I've read of any fires starting after more than 14h after charging completed.

remmbermytitans,"Sorry for the potentially repeated question(s), still trying to wrap my head around my new lease...

**Question 1:**

>Charge your vehicle more frequently and avoid depleting their battery below approximately 70 miles.

My only place to charge is in my garage, or at a public charging place while out and about. Is it safer to charge the Bolt EUV once a week at a public place (while maintaining the 30-90% threshold), or is it better to charge the Bolt EUV at home indoors to 90% while I'm awake, daily, and then park it outside as soon as it's done? I keep seeing that charging it frequently is recommended, but having a condo where my living room is right above my garage is, has me wondering what's best.

**Question 2:**

I live in SoCal, with a Black Chevy Bolt EUV. Any chance that it staying out in the sun, heating up the car (and I assume the batteries too) will affect things?

**Question 3:**

Are there currently any reports of the EUV's battery having caught fire yet? Are all Bolts more likely to catch fire while charging, sitting idly, or driving? I just need to know if I should be ready to hop out of the car while driving or not. :face_with_tears_of_joy:","<div class=""md""><p>Sorry for the potentially repeated question(s), still trying to wrap my head around my new lease...</p>

I’m on the fence, I wouldn’t lose much if I sell to carmax, maybe 2.5k over the course of about 1.5 year ownership.

But all cars now are MSRP+ and use cars are also high as well…

Tesla delivery time is pushed to early 2022…

Chip shortage has Pacifica Hybrids being low in stock + again MSRP+

ID4 using same battery….

And I don’t want to go and buy a clunker to drive until Tesla is available.

Hi friendly neighborhood GM EV tech here! First I want to say I very much appreciate all the kind words on my last post trying to keep everyone updated about the recall, it means alot to know I've been able to help so many people! I've been getting alot of PMs since then and I certainly don't mean to discourage that here. I'm always glad to help out where and when I can, but there are quite a few common reoccuring questions so I thought it'd do an FAQ post. By all means please continue to feel free to comment or pm me anytime with any other questions and although it may be delayed a bit, I always try to respond. I get dozens of them everyday so sometimes they do get automatically sent to my spam pm folder when Facebook decides you're spam, so if I don't respond it means I somehow missed it and don't hesitate to send another pm or tag me. 

1) How long have you been an EV tech?
  - I've been a certified GM tech for 15 years, high voltage certified for 10 years, and a hybrid/ev specialist at my dealer for 10 years. I love EVs, I drive a volt, and I work on hundreds of Hybrids/EVs a year. 

2) Is the dealer going to replace the whole battery or take apart my battery and replace the 5 battery sections/rows/modules? The letter I got and/or communications from GM have not been clear. 
  - As of right now we are going to replace the complete battery pack. GM sometimes refers to the complete assembly as a ""battery module"" which is causing some confusion. Adding to that confusion is the fact that GMs original plan was to try and develop a reliable way to detect the double defect cells and replace only bad sections. Using the term ""replace battery modules"" leaves the options open because this phrase is technically true weather they replace only the bad sections, all 5 sections, or the whole assembly. It is theoretically still possible that if they learn/develop a reliable way of detecting the double defect cells, after inspecting tens of thousands of returned packs, they could modify the recall to inspect and only replace bad modules. However now that LG has agreed to pay most of the cost of this recall I personally think that's pretty unlikely to happen,  but of course anything is possible. 

3) How do I get my new battery? Should I call my dealer?
  - Every bolt is currently under one of two recalls, N212345940 (2020-2022) or N212343880 (2017-2019). Once vehicles are eligible for repair they will be migrated from N212343880 to N212343881 and from N212345940 to N212345941, and a letter will be sent to you from GM informing you that you're eligible for replacement. You can also check the my chevrolet app to see if your recall number (40 or 80) has updated/migrated to the new one (41 or 81). Once you get the letter or your recall number updates you can either call a dealer and make an appointment, or call the EV concierge and they can set it up for you. They can also tell you what dealers have been certified to perform this recall. Some dealers have call centers or other people not familiar with the specifics of this recall answering the phone. If you are getting information that seems wrong ask to speak to the service manager. They should know about this recall and the process. 

4) Is there anything special I have to do before I drop my car off to have the recall performed? 
  - There's nothing that you HAVE to do, but there are two things that can help the tech and help speed up the repair. If the car is charged over 90% we have to depower it to below 90% before we can begin repairs which is a process that can take hours. Also we can't begin repairs until 24 hours after the last time it was charged, so if you took it off the charger 2 hours before you dropped it off, then we have to wait 22 hours before we can begin repairs. If you bring your bolt to the dealer with under 90% charge and 24 hours since it was last plugged in, it will be ready immediately for repairs. 

5) I've heard horrible stories/had horrible service at dealers before and I'm nervous about who does this repair. Can you tell me where to go?
  - Unfortunately I can't personally vouch for the level of morkmanship and/or customer service at other dealerships and I don't have any way to reliably find out for you. I can say that overall there are more satisfied dealership customers than there are dissatisfied ones, but bad experiences tend to get amplified on the internet and can make them seem like the majority when they are in fact the minority. Like any other large franchised business, there are some better ones and some worse ones. Your best bet is probably to ask around in the group for others who have had experiences with your local dealers. Generally speaking the more EVs they sell and service the better.

6) Where do you work? Can I bring my bolt to you? 
  - Of course you can! I work at a Chevrolet dealership in the chicagoland area and I'd love to pamper your bolt! I take a lot of pride in my workmanship and customer service and can promise I will always be honest and as fair as possible while providing high quality work with attention to detail. Feel free to pm me anytime and I can get you an appointment or answer any questions you may have. 

7) I've heard there is a new software update as well, why do we need software if we're getting a new battery? Is this software going to detect if my battery is bad?
  - This software hasn't been released yet so I don't know all the specifics on it yet. However this is what GM said on Sept 20th... 
""Within approximately 60 days, GM will begin launching a new advanced diagnostic software package that will increase the available battery charging parameters over existing guidance.
The diagnostic software will be designed to detect specific abnormalities that might indicate a damaged battery in Bolt EVs and EUVs by: monitoring the battery performance; alerting customers of any anomalies; and prioritizing damaged battery modules for replacement. It is GM's intent that further diagnostic software will allow customers to return to a 100 percent state of charge once all diagnostic processes are complete.""

8) Is it true the new batteries all have the upgraded chemistry and more range? Will there still be any charging or parking restrictions with the new battery? 
  - Yes all replacement battery packs will be N2.2 chemistry, 66kwh packs and have a new 8yr/100k limited battery warranty. I believe they said it is an 8% improvement in range on average compared to the N2.1 60kwh packs. No, there will be no charging or parking restrictions with the new batteries. 

9) Will the new battery come with the new DCFC profile?
  - Unfortunately that specific detail has not been given to us. All vehicles that currently have an N2.1 chemistry 60kwh pack will get new software to make the newer pack compatible. I would think this would most likely include the new charging profile but I can't confirm that for sure. There may be some other incompatibility or limiting factor we don't know about that prevents it.

10) When will it be my turn to get a battery? Who decides when it's my turn? If I come to you for my battery replacement can you get me pushed up the list? 
  - GM is in complete control of customer prioritization via the migrating of your vehicle from the current recall to the new recall. Prioritization is based on risk factor which is determined by build date, vehicle age & milage, charge/discharge patterns, and various other factors. The new advanced diagnostic software coming soon will also help with determining risk factor and prioritization. New batteries under this campaign are ordered by VIN and checked for eligibility by our system before the order is allowed. Dealers (or I) have no control over the prioritization. 

11) How long is it going to take to replace the battery in every bolt and complete all recall repairs?
  - Honestly, I just don't know. Realistically most of the higher risk ones will likely get done within months, the lower risk ones will obviously take longer. GM's official statement is ""We will provide replacement battery modules to dealers as quickly as possible. We continue to work with our supplier to expedite capacity for battery modules
under this recall.""

DannyMotorcycle,"Last week a Tesla was icing the charger unplugged.. out came a lazy heffer..

Before that a couple of times a Tesla was hogging the two hour limit charger all day..

So I was driving home and needed a charge to get home and I stopped at a free charger and a Tesla was plugged in.. I thought it was another a hole Tesla owner probably hogging again.. So I unplugged him and put it on my egolf..

Turns out the guy was in the car..

I plugged in. He got out and just gestured with his arms down and palms forward.. Like what the heck.. so I said I just need a little charge to get home.. In thirty miles from home and only have twenty on the dash.. Then I asked him how much charge he had and he said ten. So I have it back and apologized.

If I had a bolt I wouldn't have ran out of range.. Anyway it was his fellow Tesla owners that made me think he was just another hogger. 

Also my phone data wasn't working so it was going to be harder to find a charger.. about five min later while I was trying to look up a new charger the other spot with a Tesla in the free volta j1772 charger also became free.

I was thinking to myself bruh you have a whole network why would you let your Tesla get to ten.. But whatever.

Happy_Reply_2127,"Just discover that the data that OnStar has been collecting on our Chevy Volt without my knowledge has been completely inaccurate on several fronts.  First, my teenage son has a habit of sitting in the car while parked in the garage after baseball practice to listen to music and decompress with his seatbelt off.  The Volt captures time while in park without the seat belt engaged as time the driving time without a seatbelt.  I conducted an experiment this morning to validate this, and it’s true.  For much of his driving, it’s showing him wearing his seatbelt \~50% of the time which is a complete mischaracterization of his driving behavior.  Second, the time stamp is off by 7 hours which could result in evening driving trips being registered as late night (12a - 4a) driving.  Last, I took a spin in the Volt this morning to test the hard acceleration.  What the Volt deems to be hard acceleration is ridiculous.  The Volt registered 4 events of hard acceleration for a cruise around my neighborhood with the accelerater depressed no more than half way and what I would characterize as moderate acceleration at best.  Anyway, my insurance rates have doubled in the last 12 months with no accidents, traffic violations, or claims of any kind over many years.  What GM has done is completely unacceptable.

Nickfad,Y'all don't realize that the only reason Chevy sells EVs so hard is because all they sell are trucks and SUVs and they need to offset their emissions in certain states. Why do you think it is easier to get in some states than others? They really don't care what the dealers are selling them for esp if they can't even keep up with the demand lol. The less EVs they sell the more offsets they need to buy from their competitor Tesla lol. And they prefer to sell to fleets than to consumers because Tesla isn't in that market and they do really well and can cut out the toxic dealers lol.,"<div class=""md""><p>Y&#39;all don&#39;t realize that the only reason Chevy sells EVs so hard is because all they sell are trucks and SUVs and they need to offset their emissions in certain states.

Dachannien,"You might already be aware of this, but in case you're not, with reference to your point number 7:

EV batteries have a charge curve based on their current state of charge.  The closer it is to full, the slower it is able to accept additional charge.  When you use a route planner, it will usually try to get you as close to minimum SoC as it can when picking the next charging station, and then have you move on before you get to full charge, because you can go from 10% to 60% a lot faster than you can go from 40% to 90%.

If some of your stops were just to top off, you might already have had a high enough SoC that you were down the charge curve to 38-42 kW.

By the way, you are a braver Bolt owner than I am.  We did a road trip to Cape Cod a few years back and regretted it because of the charging situation.  Turned a 9 hour trip into closer to 12.  I can't imagine planning and executing that for ten straight days, especially through so many areas with sketchy DCFC availability.","<div class=""md""><p>You might already be aware of this, but in case you&#39;re not, with reference to your point number 7:</p>

jackass,"Got a call today from a rural dealer that has had a bolt for serveral months.  They have just the one and it is not selling.

Plus a doc fee not sure what that is .... it brings the price to 3708 below the cheapest tesla model 3 inventory car currently in my city.   I am a big fan of the bolt.... i have a 2017 with 70+k miles.  The model 3 is a bigger car and has more range.  And my guess is you would make up the 3700 in resale.

[deleted],"We've just hit 150,000 miles in our 2019 Bolt EV that we've owned just shy of 4.5 years.  Luckily, we've never had any major issues with it (knock on wood) other than the battery recall. We're mid-way through our third set of tires -- Michelin CrossClimate 2 (highly recommended).  We are on our second windshield -- a rock jumped up and cracked it fairly early in its life.  

The only minor issue that we've had is that the BSM LED on our driver-side mirror has been out for quite some time.  I asked about getting it replaced when I went in for the battery swap, and they said it would be about $300 and they would call me when the part comes in.  I ""tested"" it once, and the car beeped and counter-steered -- so the sensors work fine.  The dealership never called me back about the mirror.  My two cents...  avoid Sport Chevrolet in Silver Spring, MD -- they also had me waiting two hours for a loaner car because they weren't paying their Enterprise Rent-A-Car bills and I arrived on the morning that Enterprise decided to cut them off.  Enterprise called me and apprised me of the situation.  I had to go to the service manager and tell them to pay their friggen bills.  That left me waiting about two hours for office workers to arrive so they could slap new plates on a car to make it a loaner, and that made me late for work.

We're about to move close to where we need to be, so, we're near the end of driving about 4,000 miles per month.  It'll be a few years before we're reporting back for 200,000.

I do have a question...  150,000 miles is when you're supposed to get a coolant flush.  But IIRC, 2 of the 3 coolant lines were flushed when the battery was replaced at about 88,000 miles.  Does anybody know which line I should ask to have flushed?  I know the EV tech will know, but the intake folks will have no idea what I'm talking about so I want to be specific in my request.","<div class=""md""><p>We&#39;ve just hit 150,000 miles in our 2019 Bolt EV that we&#39;ve owned just shy of 4.5 years.

kitsum,"I'm glad to see this thread.  I've recently been looking into getting an EV and charging speed has been one of the big points in which ones I'm considering.  Hopefully people here can help since I have some questions.

I've been mostly looking at a Bolt or Kia EV6.  My electric car experience is limited, but a few years ago a friend borrowed a Tesla and we took our families from central California, where we live, to the Grand Canyon and Vegas.  Pretty long trip and at that time there weren't nearly as many charging stations as I see today.

Anyway, if I got an EV, a vast majority of the time it would be around town driving and charging at home.  Actually, my wife would be the one driving it since I usually bike to work.  About once a month though we go to LA or SF which is about 200-250 miles, we live right smack in the middle of California.  Some of those miles to the cities are going to be in the mountains too.

I'm curious how long it would take to charge and how many stops we would have to make in the Bolt vs the Kia.  I've read a lot of people talking about the Bolt being slow at fast charging and the Kia/Hyundai being very fast but honestly, how much of a difference is it?

I prefer smaller cars, and I like the way the Bolt looks and it's like 15k cheaper and they give you the L2 charger for your house.  These are all big plusses in my book.  My wife, however, likes nicer things and the Kia is bigger with the better interior quality it seems. Personally, in everything but claimed charging speed, I prefer the Bolt but we haven't actually been in either.

I can't exactly go test drive these cars since none exist around here and everyone I know who has an EV drives a Tesla and their charging situation is it's own thing so they can't really help, they just say buy a Tesla, which I'm not interested in doing.  It would be a hard sell to my wife if every time we visit family or go to Disneyland or something we're at a charging station for an hour while other cars come and go or if the difference is really that big.

Anyway, if anyone can help I would appreciate it.  It's hard getting a decent idea just watching youtube videos.","<div class=""md""><p>I&#39;m glad to see this thread.

ZnayuKAN,"Yeah, I rarely am seen at gas stations these days. In fact, the last time I was there I believe we did buy washer fluid. I've had to fill up twice since buying the car. After a while you start to realize that you never go to gas stations anymore. It's kind of nice. People with gas cars are always paranoid when you say you have a full EV. Don't you worry about running out of power? No, very rarely do I worry about that. Doesn't it take forever to charge? Well, I do it at work and over night at home so, no, not really. It takes 10 seconds to go to the side of my house, unwrap the cord, open the door on the car, and plug it in. Life is really much easier with an EV. I can look at the long lines at discount stations like Sams Club and Costco and just wave. I don't mess that at all.","<div class=""md""><p>Yeah, I rarely am seen at gas stations these days.

in other words, where this car is parked is actually for a tesla to charge at the stall to its right. the cables were made with very little slack, meaning they won't get around the back of the car to reach the other side.

DankSorceress,"This summer was a wild ride for my Bolt EV. It's my 2nd year autocrossing with it, and 1st year entering it into the STH class, a subclass of ""Class 3"" in the SCCNH series.

At the first weekend of the season, I didn't have my coilovers, so the only mods to the car were the wheels + tires, rear sway bar, and brake pads + fluid. Still, managed to finish 4th and 3rd that weekend, not bad!

The second weekend of the season I managed to have my coilovers installed, and that made a huge difference! The car really picked up a bit of pace, especially through slaloms. No understeer either, if anything the car oversteers a bit. Picked up 2nd on Saturday, and 1st on Sunday! Hence the gold medal in the last photo! Needless to say, I was thrilled.

The final weekend of the series I managed to get the car dialed in quite well, but faced some of the stiffest competition all year, a 370Z and a BRZ were both in contention of taking the win, the points were so close. I ended up taking 3rd and 2nd, enough to tie me with the BRZ for the season, and just eek ahead of the 370Z!

What a thrilling result this season. I moved up from HS thinking the Bolt would get lost in the crowd, but here I am, right at the top!","<div class=""md""><p>This summer was a wild ride for my Bolt EV.

Successful_Badger961,"I've been autocrossing my bolt as well this year. I've only got 3 events under my belt but it's taken 1st and 2nd.

Do you feel like the coilovers are what helped you this year, or just having more seat time? I ask because I'm reluctant to give up the HS modifier.

I'm currently running 225/50R16 RE-71RS and can vouch for them. They're super sticky! If the TCS wasn't so aggressive I'd probably look at an even smaller tire but I'm having a hard time sneaking power past the nanny anyway.

I've also thought about running all season rears to help the car rotate and maybe save some money. I have the rear sway bar already but still struggle with swinging the back around.","<div class=""md""><p>I&#39;ve been autocrossing my bolt as well this year.

Perhaps most importantly it <strong>is</strong> GM, but then I&#39;m hardly in a pinch here.</p>

<p>Regardless good news. So many Bolts where I live, reminds me of how popular they are even given their minor downsides.</p>

Cannavor,"Hmm, my state is implementing an excise tax credit for EVs up to $3000 starting in July. For a base model Bolt EUV at MSRP the excise tax would be $1691.70 so this window of full-tax-credit would be decreasing the price by $1558.30 compared to the price of buying it after July assuming the battery portion of the requirements is implemented but not met.

For the one that was still in stock for me, I had to frequently call back the dealer until he got a stock number and found it was waiting in Michigan for some part and I had to pay $1k over MSRP to secure it in a presale as the dealers are equally aware that it's still a better deal for buyers to pay a little more today to snag that bonus chunk of the credit.

Just want to make sure I appropriately temper people's expectations.

Etrigone,"Lol yeah that thread. Lately I'm not sure if trolls, bots, people who just get off on the negative attention... or what. Whatever it is, it's not just Bolts getting dissed for whatever.

I mean, both my partner & I come from large families, 6 kids each, and we know how much growing kids can eat. My mom had a station wagon for a reason, but it wasn't like she couldn't carry several of us as well as groceries (after all, who else was going to load/unload the car?)

During the height of the pandemic I would shop for admittedly just the two of us, but I'd often get two weeks of food in one go. *Never* had to do more than the hatch, didn't drop down the false floor. It might have been a little packed but that just kept stuff from sliding around - which when I had a loaner Equinox was a serious annoyance. We roadtrip in the car and carry back stuff (wine mostly), tend to carry a cooler, don't pack that light and still no problem.

It's certainly possible to not have enough room in back, and I am mildly curious on what that upper end is. I'm just not buying the stories barring more that what I've seen.","<div class=""md""><p>Lol yeah that thread.

theotherharper,"Paint guy here.  A wild color like that is actually very difficult to achieve and involves more expensive paint.  So to a degree, it is subsidized.  

Scientists, fighting some racist ideas, were looking for why some children had developmental issues, and they found cheap paint with white lead pigment.  Tragically, titanium dioxide white was also cheap, so that was utterly needless.  But the result was, lead and other heavy metal based mineral pigments were banned from non-artist paints.   And this took out all the wonderful, cheap, durable, bold color pigments based on lead and chromium.

What's left in bright colors? Organic pigments - which are either very costly, or, cheap and quickly degrade in sunlight (random rattle-can spray paint, this is why your OSHA Yellow Krylon spray can turns into OSHA Beige.  

I normally pay $160/gal for my black and white very high quality marine paint, but when I tried buying burgundy it was $340.  For the pigments.  

So the safe, cheap, stable mineral pigments are down to carbon black, or titanium white, and most other pigments are organic.  Now gaze across any random parking lot and what do you see?   Fifty shades of gray.  Now you know why.  

Automakers don't want 5-year-old cars looking rough, so they generally dig deep in their pockets and use the best organic pigments, just like my marine paint supplier. 

All that to say, that is one costly deluxe paint job, so appreciate it!","<div class=""md""><p>Paint guy here.  A wild color like that is actually very difficult to achieve and involves more expensive paint.  So to a degree, it is subsidized.  </p>

I happened to come across the bolt last year when the price dropped $6,300. So happy I put my order in and got it - with $7,500 off of that too! 

This beautiful car. With gorgeous color options, I fell in love with the blacked out redline when I saw it in person. The storm trooper, the ice blue, the grey ghost with a hint of purple. Thank you GM. 

With fucking supercruise, an absolute luxury feature on a $30,000 car. Not to mention heated and cooled seats, even heated in the back which impresses everyone I show. This gorgeous interior. Thank you GM. 

With an engineered battery system that they made it easy on us, just drive it and charge it however you’d like. The battery will outlast the car. Thank you GM. 

I love my car - the first car Ive ever bought new. I’ve never been able to afford a new car, they built a car that will save me money over the next 5-10 years and make this much cheaper than buying a used car. 

For all of this, thank you GM.

Nothing on the market is even close to the price point I got that can go over 200 miles.,"<div class=""md""><p>I bought my 2020 Bolt EV LT for $20k in 2020.

Powerful-Disaster-32,"I feel for you, your wife and your Bolt.  My prayers are that she gets the proper medical care and heals fast.  I had a similar situation in April 2023.  My 2017 Bolt was rear ended by Speed Racer driving a Jetta at 70MPH.  I was stopped waiting to make a right turn.  He was attemptig to pass a slower moving vehicle in the center of three lanes by passing on the inside.  He didn't look and I was there.  My Bolt did a 180 and the rear was more or less all over the road.

My recommendation is to really dig into the valuation that the third-party adjuster will make.  Look at every line and every feature on every comp.  Don't let them get away with saing that your Bolt was in fair or good condition.  Mine was in excelltnt and I had interior and exterior pictures to prove it.  Take them.  Many mistakes were initially made in every feature that my Bolt had (Premium fully loaded) vs comparable vehcicles.  I had to argue for every one and correct mistakes.  Don't accept the first version of the report.      Keep pushing and get your insurance company involved.  They will assist you. 

Be sure to get credit for sales tax, tire condition, unexpired registration and anything else.  It all adds up to your vehicle value at the time of the collision.  

Look into your insurance policy if there is any risk of under insurance in the at fault party.  My insurance had to initially cover the loss and then seek subogration against the other party insurance.  I found out that my policy had a 20% bonus to the settled value for a totaled vehicle.  The at fault insurance company would have never had that.  

You are going to get screwed by the recent decline in  selling price.  With all of the used Bolts on the marked from GM buybacks and Hertz dumping their inventory, the price has plumeted.  In April 2023 the price was much higher.  I ended up settling for just about my initial 2017 purchase price net of federal tax credit and state rebate.  This covered the purchase of our 2023 EUV Premier net of federal tax credit and state rebate.  

Good luck.  If you want to send me a message, I will be happy to have a conversation.  I didn't go with an attorney and represented myself.  You should seek counsel and make a decision.  It sounds like your wife's injuries may have been similar to the concussion and whiplash that I had.","<div class=""md""><p>I feel for you, your wife and your Bolt.

The real problem is that GM should make a new EV the size of the Bolt EUV, on the BEV3 ""Ultium"" platform. It should be cheaper than the Equinox EV, which will start at $30K.

As for the Volt, there's plenty of plug-in hybrids on the market. I don't understand why you miss that one. (I also think that plug-in hybrids are all going to be gone in about 5 years, with the exception of tow vehicles... an F150 lightning can only pull a 16 foot travel trailer about 100 miles.)","<div class=""md""><p>We have a Bolt EUV and love the car!

I had something of a similar experience with mine. Not much you can do about it other than quit and walk away but with cars like these that may mean not ever getting a Bolt (or not for a very long time).

[deleted],"Couple of things:

First, a dealer in California can charge a deposit, but no more than 2.5% of the sale price, and only on a car that they are brokering, which requires a written contract. In other words, no contract, no deposit. So, whatever you've given them, demand it back. If they refuse, you have recourse.  
  
With that out of the way, where did you go? If you're willing to travel back to California for a Bolt, I cannot strongly enough recommend that you contact Randy Pittner at Simpson Chevrolet in Irvine (they have a Garden Grove lot, as well). Randy is the internet sales manager there.  
  
Last year, my wife and I were looking for an EV, and had settled on the Ioniq 5, until it became apparent that they weren't actually sub-$50k cars in reality, so we pivoted to the EUV, after GM announced the price cut on the 2022s. We'd put out feelers when we found listings that fit our criteria on the internet, and one was at Simpson. I wound up talking to Randy, who said that it had ""just sold,"" so I just brushed it off as the usual dealer bait-and-switch.

Then, about two months later, we get a call from him out of the blue. They've got a Silver Flare EUV Premier that just cleared inspection following the battery swap, any chance we can make it down? I can't remember if we went down that day, but I think he called on a Friday and we went down on Saturday.

Either way around, there it was. Sun & Sound, no Super Cruise; exactly what we wanted (though the color *was* our third option). Best of all: **no markup**, and **no dealer-installed bullshit**. We already had financing, enough for an Ioniq 5. They didn't try to run us through their finance department. They went over the list of dealer installed bullshit that they *could* add, and then never went back to it after we declined. They openly acknowledged that our down payment was enough to make GAP coverage pointless. 

In fact, the only issue was that the car hadn't been properly flashed (the recalled vehicles all had an update that prevented them from charging above something like 60%, and the tech had flashed the wrong update to it), so I wouldn't be able to take it home today, but they would drive it out to me once it was ready.

Here's the second kicker: there was another EUV on the lot, exactly the same but in Summit White. It was actually under contract, but the guy who was buying it was out of the country on business or something like that, and already had a Bolt EV (I think?), and wasn't in any great rush, so he'd actually authorized the dealer to sell that one if someone was interested in it, and he'd wait for another. Our preapproval was enough to swing it, especially after we sold one of our older cars...

[deleted],"Some thoughts that might make you feel better.

This dealer is doomed by the automobile market's moves to maintenance-free electric vehicles and direct-to-consumer sales.  They are milking their last years of sales with desperate tactics, but the owners will have little more to show for their years of investment in this business.  Their children will pass on tales about how the family lost its fortune by not getting out in time.

The sales manager who lured you with false promises will have to look for a new job with a resume tainted by GM dealer tactics.
