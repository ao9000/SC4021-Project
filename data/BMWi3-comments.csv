TechieEngr,"I did the same thing too back in June. Only difference is I placed a board resting on the armrest and rear folded seatbacks to support the mattress. I'm also 5'10. I have the following tips:

1. You better be a good packer because you need to move all your belongings to the footwells. Things you may need when you're sleeping (eg; bottled water...etc) needs to be ON TOP, and near the sides of the car so you can reach down to grab it. Rear parcel shelf will fit ON TOP of your front seats.
2. AC will only run when NOT plugged in. The moment you plug in, it will switch to FAN. Many have argued they can switch to ""comfort climate"" (same as ""precondition"") mode, but that will only run 30 minutes.
3. You pretty much have very little room to maneuver once the doors are closed, so you really need to get EVERYTHING ready for bedtime before climbing in. Climbing in from the rear is MUCH easier than from the sides. Closing the rear hatch (with your toes) is the best/most comfortable way due to limited room. Ideally you should erect a canopy tent and clean tarp on the ground so you can have a ""clean area"" to walk barefoot and stow your dirty shoes before climbing in. Having that extra space will also help with moving your other items in the sheltered area so you wouldn't need to shove them in the footwell and repack them next morning. A simple (Walmart) square canopy tent with walls will do, no need for fancy or expensive ""Carsule"" tents.
4. You can cut pieces of cardboard/other material...etc to cover your side/rear windows for privacy
5. I don't know if I'd be comfortable sharing a twin mattress with another person, the face-to-roof-liner room is already quite limited. Maybe I'm just fat (I'm 200lbs).
6. Actual % of battery used will depend on outside temperature vs inside set temperature. If it's a warm night, it will consume more versus a cooler night. But keeping the humidity and bugs out is a definite plus in my book. You'd also get the extra protection if you're camping in bear country. I used about 12% during my overnight AC run.
7. A little common sense tip, but LOCK all doors when you sleep.
8. Have your keyfob nearby so you can ""pop the trunk"" when you're ready to exit instead of struggling to open the front-then-rear door. Rear door handles serve as convenient storage areas for your phone/keyfob...etc.
9. If you want to charge your phone, make sure to have a USB/charging cord long enough to reach the door handles mentioned in #8.
10. Because the mattress will be slightly inclined (due to higher armrest height vs the rear folded seats), sleeping with your head nearest the front seats will be the most comfortable position.
11. If the temperature drops to a much more comfortable level at night, you can open the moonroof for fresh air (if you have one) and use the factory roller shade as a ""bug screen"" - since it's just a piece of thin fabric anyway. 

Your i3 will pretty much be like a tiny air conditioned camper (like a Helio HE3) or a ""Japanese capsule hotel"". The advantage is that you can run the AC all night without plugging in, and the AC isn't a noisy hulking machine blowing right behind your head. Hence - your quality of sleep will be much better. It'll ONLY be good for sleeping - not much room for anything else; other than maybe find a way to hang your tablet/phone on the ceiling so you can watch a movie.","<div class=""md""><p>I did the same thing too back in June.

So is anyone looking into the 40e hybrid battery?

Between a new battery and new battery tech (the battery tech in these is now 10+ years old) it should be a great way to give life to these cars. BMW did build a great drivetrain into the 40e (thankfully!) but the battery is pretty meh.

thanks!","<div class=""md""><p>Is this project still alive? - I have a friend with an i3 considering a replacement battery.</p>

QuieroTamales,"I stopped at an EA station yesterday.  I plugged into station #1 (0-150kW)...charge could not initiate and I couldn't unplug the car.  Called EA and they rebooted the station and they said try station #2 (0-150kW).  It got as far as asking for payment....  Nothing.  EA rep reboots that station, I unplug, then try again.  This time, my card(s) were declined.  The EA rep then asks if I could move to station #5 (ugh).  Still nothing.  Did I mention that there's no shade and it's 95 degrees outside? 

She rebooted the station, and asked if I had an EA account.  (I don't).  She said I could download the app and create an account as that would allow them some more options as far as charging goes. (?)  I had about 35 miles left on the battery, so I said no thank you, maybe some other time.  

To her credit, the EA rep was very kind, but I decided to give up for the day.  I went home and downloaded the EA app and created an account with the plan of trying again today.

I stopped in to station #7 today (0-350kW), plugged in, and without any payment and without tapping my phone or otherwise giving them any identifying info, I was surprised to hear the station's fans spin up, and it started to charge.  Huh?    16 kWh for free.  Sweet.

tjsean0308,"I need to throw this out there. I charged 30 times nearly back to back on EA with my 18 i3. One time I had to unplug and start the session with the app. I far and away prefer EA to the other networks. 

What year are your cars that don't like EA? Have you had the software in the car updated? 

Now Harley Davidson chargers on the Chargepoint network. Forget those things, never had one work ever.

Edit: Just double checked the charging log on my EA app. 28 out of 34 sessions were on EA and the average cost for a full session was $5 with the plus membership at .31cents a kWh. I seriously had no issues using tap to pay on iOS wallet device. It was awesome, and way cheaper than the chargepoint 24kW DC stations that charge $5 and hour for the first hour and $10 and hour after that. With a 24kW charger it's usually $15 bucks to get a charge. EA is way better in my experience.","<div class=""md""><p>I need to throw this out there.

<p>Now Harley Davidson chargers on the Chargepoint network. Forget those things, never had one work ever.</p>

<p>Edit: Just double checked the charging log on my EA app. 28 out of 34 sessions were on EA and the average cost for a full session was $5 with the plus membership at .31cents a kWh. I seriously had no issues using tap to pay on iOS wallet device. It was awesome, and way cheaper than the chargepoint 24kW DC stations that charge $5 and hour for the first hour and $10 and hour after that. With a 24kW charger it&#39;s usually $15 bucks to get a charge. EA is way better in my experience.</p>

skyspydude1,"I'd already posted earlier as I'm selling my '17 REx, but I know there were some who wanted me to compare them a little. Now that I've had the i3s for a week, I can give a bit of insight. I'll sort these into a few different sections that came to mind in comparing them. 

&nbsp;



***Interior***

While the interior hasn't changed much in the i3, there's an immediate and noticeable difference in the seat leather. The texture/feel is way different, even ignoring any sort of wear. I think the new one feels a bit better, but it's really just preference. Not much else, other than I absolutely love the blue seatbelts, and will help me feel a little less sad about losing the Protonic Blue.

&nbsp;

***Technology***

Since the i3 hasn't changed a ton, even with the LCI, I wasn't expecting a huge difference. Really, there's not any one big thing that's changed, but a lot of little things that make a world of difference and really make it feel like a much better car.

* The behavior of ACC is SO MUCH BETTER. Having worked on these systems, the aggressiveness of the ACC in my '17 was downright obnoxious in stop & go traffic. It now anticipates movement far better than the old one, and I used it far more than I normally would. It also definitely drives more efficiently, which is a nice plus.

* iDrive 6.0 is nice, but not a game changer really. The voice recognition is way less janky, and it's much better at address entries. It's not really on par with some brand new systems, but it makes the car feel much newer.

* The adaptive headlights are really nice, especially having the LED high beams. It always felt weird using ye olde halogens for the high beams on such a high tech car, and now the headlights actually match.

&nbsp;

***Drivetrain***

This is obviously going to be one of the biggest differences and it's something that I'd known from research that it was certainly different, but I wasn't prepared for just how significant it was. While the i3 already feels like a jet taking off, building power from 0-20MPH then throwing you back until about 50MPH, the i3s has a similar power curve in Comfort, but it just continues on way past the normal i3. The power is just always there, even at 80MPH, which is huge for driving on American freeways. 

Sport mode is just something else entirely. Think how the car feels going from Eco Pro into Comfort in terms of power and throttle response. Now take that, and from Comfort and into Sport. I took the car to an AutoX on day 2 of owning it, and even with two passengers managed to set a very respectable time. One of my personal favorite comments was a ""Holy fuck how is this so fast??"" from a passenger (whose daily is a tuned Audi RS4) when we accelerated down a straight section of course. There's still only so much grip in a 175 tire, but it did wonderfully and I was pleased at the warm reception. 

It's definitely a special use case driving mode, because if it were the default, I can almost guarantee you'd need a new set of rear tires in under 5k miles.

&nbsp;

***Suspension***

My '17 had spacers and lowering springs, which was a must for all the highway driving I did. It eliminated a lot of the twitchiness at higher speeds and made it far more planted. Comparing to the modded non-S, the i3s feels just a touch more confident overall. I think this has more to do with the tires than anything else, but it's nice regardless. Looks-wise, the i3s sits a little higher than I'd like and I'll probably get the same lowering springs for it down the road. Even on the non-S it makes a big difference visually, and makes the i3 look a little less like a scaled up Matchbox car.

&nbsp;

***BEV vs REx***

When I bought the first i3, I only had the one car and needed the REx for some potential long trips. Sure enough, about 2 weeks later I had to drive about 1200mi for a funeral, and it did wonderfully. 

My main reason for going BEV over REx wasn't so much an issue with the REx itself, but its weight. In my mind if I were going to upgrade to an S, I really wanted to appreciate the extra power and better handling, and I no longer really needed it. I bought the i3s in Atlanta and drove it myself back to Detroit, so I really got the BEV-only road trip experience. There were a couple of points I missed having the REx (charging infrastructure in Ohio is somewhat lacking), but taking a relaxed approach to the trip meant that it wasn't a big deal. Definitely not a great choice if you're a ""power through"" roadtripper, but with ""only"" ~150 mi of range it did great and I had no real range anxiety. Around town, I almost never used the REx except during long trips in winter, since our other car (A Niro PHEV) handles most long trips anyways.
TL;DR REx is wonderful with an only car, but BEV is great if you have other options.


&nbsp;

***Options***

This isn't really a comparison between age/type, but still notable. They're both Tera World, but the REx only had PDC and the Tech+, while the i3s has every possible option. Sunroof, HK, heatpump (which was actually insanely hard to find), and the blue seatbelts :). I think that for the price most of the options are worth it, but I'd say only the heat pump + Tech packages are 100% must haves. 

&nbsp;

***Overall thoughts/TL;DR***

If I could sum it up as quickly as possible, I would say ""This is the car BMW should have released at the start"". Obviously I understand the many factors that made that difficult on the early i3, but I sincerely think that with the i3s as an option from the start the car would have done far better, especially in the USA. It gets rid of all the twitchy weird handling of a stock i3, feels far more confident on our big open freeways, and the upgrade is 100% worth the price of admission.","<div class=""md""><p>I&#39;d already posted earlier as I&#39;m selling my &#39;17 REx, but I know there were some who wanted me to compare them a little.

papapayaa,"Switch of job forces me to return my beloved Polestar 2 company car, which replaced a Tesla Model 3. As you can imagine I've been bitten by the EV bug and really don't want to return to ICE. I rarely do any longer trips and live in an area of town with a lot of narrow streets, so I figured downsizing is probably the right choice.

After eliminating a lot of the smaller EV's available here in Sweden, as they lack the refinement I'm used to, I narrowed it down to find a later model i3 or i3S. Almost all of the late models here are basically specced with none of the options that I want, i.e. H/K, Nav Pro, any interior other than Neutronic. The few examples that pop up seems to sell within hours. I almost gave up my search, but today I was lucky, as a fully loaded 2021 black i3s appeared locally! I've looked at the brochures from the period and I can't find anything it's missing. It's got the H/K, Nav Pro, Suite interior, sunroof, all the driving assists and camera. I called the dealer within 15 minutes of the ad appearing, three hours later I signed the papers!

<p>Not the happiest i3 owner now... maybe again someday if the repair holds together for a long time...</p>

showMeTheSnow,"Welcome.

The i3 is definitely the drivers car of those, all that torque and FWD isn't a great combo either.  I drove FWD for ages, and boy doni appreciate that the i3 is RWD.

The battery management system on the i3 is quite good.  Don't worry about charging at half.  Charging more is better than charging less. The main thing to avoid, IMO, is running it low, and leaving it there.

Otherwise charge when convenient, and enjoy.  

We charge our 21 less because it's got more range.  I just drove it 30 miles, I'm not gonna plug it in, because we don't have a big trip planned.  When it gets around 1/3 or so, I plug it in.  Or, if I think we might be going some distance in the near future.","<div class=""md""><p>Welcome.</p>

mattthemountainman,"Echo what others have said here about charging. Unlike the Leaf, the thermal management, battery management system and cell balancing are excellent. Charging to 100 percent every once in a while at a minimum is good for the car so it can balance the cells. Leaving at very low state of charge for long periods is one of the few things that can degrade these Samsung cells. 

The coolant for the battery and air conditioning is one in the same, and the compressor that runs them (including some scenarios when charging the car) car go on the 2017 and before models, but the 2018+ seem to have that sorted out. That component has a higher duty cycle than a standard AC compressor in a gas car. If you ever hear grinding/vibration/funny sound, replace before it fails.

Muted-Potential-7800,"Bought my Wife a 2019 i3s. I’m a car junkie, and I love it. Its purpose is as a second car, urban runabout. Long trips we take my car. She puts under 3k in miles annually. I think BMW dropped the ball when they discontinued this model.  I know a lot of people with the same circumstances, two car family, one is only used for short jaunts around town. Groceries, pick up the kids, visit friends, doctor appointments. They worked out all the bugs. And dumped it. The only unfortunate part is I frequently use it when she’s not, so the mileage will go up faster than I had planned, but what a blast to drive, and put together well.
Maybe a day will come when long range, fast charge solid state batteries will make the little car appealing to a larger market. I would add that as a home owner we charge at the convenience of our location and don’t rely on charging stations. That’s a game changer for a lot of people","<div class=""md""><p>Bought my Wife a 2019 i3s. I’m a car junkie, and I love it. Its purpose is as a second car, urban runabout. Long trips we take my car.

Alfachick,"So after a whole day of ownership initial thoughts: 

1. The single pedal driving will probably take about a week of getting used to.  But already is awesome and something I will definitely miss in other cars. 

2. I am likely to stall the other household car when I drive that next. 

3. Accelerating away from a speed limited area when it goes back to national speed limit and leaving tailgaters in the dust is never going to get old. Ever. 

4. The ride is pretty harsh on the huge wheels, I would have speced the 18” wheels with thicker rubber on them to help absorb some of the bumps a bit better. 

5. We need to get an outside plug fitted as a matter of urgency.  Will get just a three pin plug fitted next week (mate is an electrician) and probably get a wall box once the company salary sacrifice kicks in for getting those installed. Currently charging at home is not secure so realistically can’t be done overnight. 

6. Yet to use a public charger so that will be a whole new adventure. 

7. Motorway driving is fine although the car feels quite light on the road. Crosswinds can be a bit hairy. 

8. It feels like being in the future.","<div class=""md""><p>So after a whole day of ownership initial thoughts: </p>

CheekyHusky,"The last few years I've been working really hard on my career, managed to triple my salary through study, promotion & a recent new job. 

Before I was driving a 2006 polo. My new job has free charging at work and I was paying around £300 a month in petrol due to petrol price increase. So turning 300 into 0 was a no brainer. 

But I didn't expect to love this car so much. I'm not a car guy. I drive a to b. Hence why I drove an old car for so long. Not to mention i wouldnt of been able to afford this car before. 

But this car.. oh my god. I couldn't stop yesterday. I put about 50 miles on the clock. I love it! 

This feels like such a huge reward for everything I've been doing and it's the best reward. I've been stalking this sub for a while, reading your reviews, advice and opinions on this car which is what ultimately lead me to get it. So thank you all for that!","<div class=""md""><p>The last few years I&#39;ve been working really hard on my career, managed to triple my salary through study, promotion &amp; a recent new job. </p>

ApostrophePosse,"I was in a head-on with a Lincoln Town Car Limo with both of us going about 30mph or more. Demolished front end but slid off the wreck at the carbon fiber life module ending up perpendicular to the crash. Every air bag in the car fired. The Lincoln's momentum carried it for a full block before it stopped. I kicked the door open and climbed out completely unhurt. 

Happened about a mile from home. After all the pieces were resolved, I just walked back to my house. 

I can't find it but there is a crash test video that exactly shows what happened to mine.

steveb68,"**Hey, Everyone!**

I'm NOT just a lurker (1+ years lurking now) anymore. I took receipt of my **'17 i3 three days** ago and the love affair continues to blossom...

Having only sat in an i3 on a local lot once (even though I have been lurking and learning for over a year) the experience of sitting in my own i3 and learning all about it viscerally is, well, overwhelming in a nice way.

I've had a chance to play/learn a lot since it came off the truck. **Trying hard not to wake up at 2 in the morning and sneak out to fiddle with controls or take it for a spin around the block! ...Lol**

Here's some pics of my beauty before, during, and after mounting the new Blizzak/OEM-wheel set at the local Discount Tire. Luckily I already had the tires and wheels at the Tire store and as they were getting mounted the 1st real snow of the season started. Now a day later we are 4-5 inches deep all over my area. The Blizzaks feel great and I've had NO problems with good traction in the snow and ice. Oh! One of the really cool things about my car is that even though it wasn't billed as having Auto Park, it does! I'm pretty sure the dealer didn't know. It's PRETTY cool!

[deleted],"If you don't have one already - get a dedicated circuit at home for charging - 240 V 40 A, with a full-power EVSE (home charging station.) Don't rely on the included ""portable charger.""

Life with an EV is *A LOT* easier when you can fill it up every night by just taking a few seconds to plug in to the car.

Learn the feel of the pedal - it will take some time. Learn to single-pedal drive.

If you will need to travel close to the maximum range, learn to be gentle on the accelerator, and switch to ECO PRO mode. Set the climate control to the ""least comfortable you can tolerate"" for the conditions (so set to 64 or even 62 when it's cold out, 74-78 when it's hot, if you can tolerate those.) Use seat heaters in the cold, leaving the climate control on a lower temperature than you'd like.

If you get snow tires - KEEP THEM INFLATED PROPERLY.  Take them off the moment you think you won't get any more snow, and don't drive them if it's above 50°F. If you have a local shop that can fill tires with Nitrogen, do that. The snow tires that are available for the i3 wear out *VERY* quick - you'll be lucky if you get 3 seasons out of them.","<div class=""md""><p>If you don&#39;t have one already - get a dedicated circuit at home for charging - 240 V 40 A, with a full-power EVSE (home charging station.)

rontombot,"Beautiful! That color is probably at the top of my list to replace my 2015 Arravani Grey Tera BEV... but I got myself hooked on a ""has every option"" model... so finding my replacement is going to be tough. 

Gotta get one with a higher capacity battery... 40 miles each way to work in sub-freezing temperatures means full charge & discharge twice a day. 

REX need not apply... my whole plan and reason was to divorce myself from any/all ICE worries... I'm 60+ and I've had enough... been messing with cars my whole life... it was fun when I was younger... now simple is fun! (and quick!) 

 I thought it was going to be tough... giving up my 32-valve quad-cam all aluminum V8 with as much intake roar as exhaust... but never having to do the gas station thing ever again makes up for it! (not including spark plug changes, oil changes, radiator issues, and worrying about the transmission... and on, and on...) 

My @ home full charge at night (from 0 miles remaining sometimes!) costs less than $0.75... I've got good winter rates:beaming_face_with_smiling_eyes:.  

Sadly, my daytime charge makes up for it at about $3 a day... for now... until my employer gets the EV chargers installed! I work at a very progressive, very major, very large electronics mfr in the Midwest... and no EV chargers yet... very odd.","<div class=""md""><p>Beautiful!
