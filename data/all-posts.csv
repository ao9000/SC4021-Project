It looks like we are ditching the multiple options and just sticking with one single pack for the i3 going forward.

It will initially provide \~200 miles (322 km) of highway driving range in most conditions with the initial usable capacity of about 48kWh\*. We may unlock more range later on if conditions allow.

It will use an improved liquid thermal management system that operates alongside the current phase-change cooling and resistive heating solution.

The mass should be very similar to the current 120Ah i3.

120kW DC fast charging support!

Cost: \~$8k USD. You may trade in your old battery pack to bring down your investment cost significantly. 10-year warranty.

\-----------------

The issues we face currently:

We need our cell manufacturing to be operational to make these packs at these costs. Meaning that they may be delayed until 2023-2024. We can provide them sooner but at a significantly higher cost.

We are not planning to offer installation in multiple locations. Just at our factory in Maryland, USA. We are depending on automotive shops or upcoming EV shops for installation.

\-----------------

Lastly, we are hiring!

Consider joining us if you want to work on everything energy related.

Get in contact with me here, positions will be available soon for both Maryland and remote.

\-----------------

There are extra stuff there that are not included in Connected Drive.

Now to come up with an open source package to deal with this 3G sunset that doesn't cost $1400.

It should be a DIY thing and/or a low cost module.

Details will go up on GitHub as soon as I find some time.

The only reason she is going is my kids at 10 and 14 really do not fit anymore so she has to go. I bought her from BMW as an ex demonstrator and had every extra even the useless sun roof and traffic jam assist but also the great heat pump which kept my range in winter.  

In 100,000kms of driving servicing costs have been under ‚Ç¨1000 for 2 sets of tyres and front brake rotors. The battery still shows the same capacity from the day I picked up and it still feels like driving a go cart. I am really sad to see it go, I am mad that I cannot keep her as they will surely be a future classic as they still look fresh today as they did when launched 10 years ago and who can pass up a carbon fibre tub and aluminium chassis but I need the trade in for my next car. 

I looked and test drove the next generation of electric BMW‚Äôs, but I feel BMW has lost the plot and gone backwards with their design. 

So I am off to Mercedes and a bit of an upgrade in class as I will take the plunge and treat myself to the EQE. ",,,BMWi3,Goodbye dear friend‚Ä¶.Darth,0.97,https://i.redd.it/rd2dab8n2zkc1.jpeg

I received the email from ConnectedDrive services stating as much and I'd get free services until the end date, even though I had already renewed service until Nov 2021, so 3 months free. Some laughed it off and have let their subscriptions lapse long ago. I for one like the ability to set the car to cool before I get to the door, and real time traffic is very useful to avoid jams along my routes.

I read posts of the 4G TCU part number that directly replaces the 3G TCU, posts of other BMW model owners talking about the upgrade and a single post of an i3 owner that got their broken 3G TCU replaced with a 4G one under warranty. I decided to get my 3G TCU replaced when I brought my i3 in for HV battery warranty test (see other post). All out of pocket.

I gave the service rep the 4G TCU part number (84-10-6-836-777) to order because I was not sure they would install if I bought it outside of their supply chain, and put  the work order to replace the 3G one and program its replacement. At first they sound unsure that this could be done but I replied that the only thing needed to be done is to program with ISTA+, which I don't have access to and no expertise to use it. Maybe contact ConnectedDrive in addition.

So when I went to take back the car to await the arrival of the replacement battery modules they've already replaced the TCU, and I successfully activated cooling as I walked to the car. They gave me the 3G TCU as a keepsake, and I managed to query the tech that performed the upgrade. Sure enough, the only thing they had to do is program the TCU using ISTA+. Looks like it is a drop in replacement.

I still need to contact ConnectedDrive to make sure they don't deactivate my VIN when Feb 2022 rolls around but it has been working fine for about a month now. All it cost is \~$1400 parts and labor. I'm sure if you order the TCU online and/or have access to ISTA+ the costs would be lower than having the dealership do everything but this proves:

**TL;DR:**

BMW is full of it when they tell you that there is no way to upgrade your TCU. They just don't want to put up any money even for a discount.

Here are pics of the work order, plus old and new module and its connectors.[https://imgur.com/a/YOFzFSh](https://imgur.com/a/YOFzFSh)

**UPDATE January 27, 2022:**

I have made a post chronicling my attempts at keeping ConnectedDrive service working as the February deadline is nearly upon us [HERE](https://www.reddit.com/r/BMWi3/comments/s9qbps/on_the_road_to_3g_disconnect/).

I have a lot more information and will have a fuller update out tomorrow or Tuesday, but I wanted to get this out as soon as I could.  


## ELI5 (EXPLAIN LIKE I'M FIVE)

You're going to effectively get a new battery. This will take time, so be patient. GM has finally stood up to LG and will do what they can to do right by all us owners. In the mean time, follow the instructions below to reduce your risk.  


## WHAT IS HAPPENING?

All 2017-2019 are going to get new replacement modules that will bring the battery capacity to 66kWh and range up to 259 miles EPA (8% increase to original range, same as 2020+).The priority will go to highest risk first - we're told early 2019s which do deep discharges. Then proceed based on risk level.

The 2020+ model years will get new replacement modules unless a process can be devised which will allow detection of faulty modules in the field. If this happens, then refurbished modules may be used to replace the defective modules in order to speed up the replacement cycle and reduce waste, and non-defective modules will be left. After you get the replacement, you will be back to full range (or upgraded range for 2017-2019), with no restrictions. Everyone will get a new 8-year 100k mile warranty effective date of service.

No modules are available yet as all have the potential problems. Until GM can ensure safe cells are produced and in vehicles, no replacements will be done and there is a stop sale on all Bolts of all years.

[Most recent details here](https://electrek.co/2021/08/20/gm-expands-bolt-recall-to-all-chevy-bolts-blames-supplier-lg/)  


## WHAT THE HECK IS A MODULE?

The battery contains 288 cells, split into 10 modules in 5 serviceable pairs called rows. GM's PR team is referring to the row as a module, so from their communications there are 5 modules in a Bolt battery. Using their parlance, four modules have 60 cells, and the fifth module (on top under the rear seat) has 48 cells.  


## WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN REPLACING ALL MODULES AND REPLACING THE BATTERY?

The battery contains a lot of electronics, wiring, relays, the battery computer, and the battery shell (which is a very strong structural member of the car). There are no problems with these components, so they do not need to be replaced. The net result is that you will have the core components of your battery - the actual cells - brand new. That's the important part.  


## WHY AREN'T THEY JUST REPLACING ALL BATTERIES?

For speed and cost. It's cheaper and way easier to ship modules, and the division of labor will allow quicker turnaround times by just replacing the modules in the field.  


## WHAT ARE THE DETAILS ON THE PROBLEM?

GM has found the manufacturing processes that can cause a torn anode (battery tab) and folded separators present in all LG lines that produced Bolt cells, in both South Korea and both plants in the United States. As a result all Bolts are potentially at risk. More details on this tomorrow.  


## HOW WILL GM ENSURE THAT THE NEW CELLS ARE SAFE?

They will be able to, I've spoken to them, more on this tomorrow.  


## HOW LONG WILL THIS TAKE?

We don't know exactly yet, but more on this tomorrow.  


## WHICH DEALERS WILL BE ABLE TO HANDLE THIS?

The module replacement is a relatively straight forward thing, and there are enough checks within the car and the process that it is safe for any EV certified technician to do. Any dealer that sells the Bolt must have at least one EV certified technician on staff. It's significantly easier than replacing an engine, for example. If you do not know which dealers have an EV certified technician you can call the concierge (see below).  


## WHAT CAN I DO TO REDUCE MY RISK?

If you can: reduce your charging limit to 90% (or hilltop reserve on 2017-2018), and do not run below about 30% state of charge. If you can't do this, then either get as close as you can or ask GM to provide a free loaner or rental (see below). Park outside away from anything flammable or that could be damaged by massive amounts of water.

Either way - use departure mode charging to only charge up before you leave. Do not leave the vehicle charging unattended. Avoid deep discharging - plug in as soon as you can. You can use OBD2 to check for cell voltages or to dive deep into your car's data if you want low level information. - [https://allev.info/boltpids/](https://allev.info/boltpids/)

You could also get a wireless interconnected smoke alarm that ties in with your house alarm, and put it in the rear seat of your Bolt. This may give you a few minutes extra notice.

You can also get a ""J1772 extension"" cable to give you more length to charge outdoors. Just search in Google or Amazon for that term.  


## WHAT IF I CAN'T DO FOLLOW THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS?

Do as much as you can. It will not impact your ability to have warranty or get your battery modules replaced. If you don't accept the risk, GM will provide you with a loaner or rental. See below.  


## SHOULD I CHARGE AT L1 OR DCFC OR REDUCED CURRENT?

No - the safest charging is Level 2 32A. This is closest to the ""sweet spot"" of charging speed for lithium ion. Slower than that or DCFC is less ideal. If these are your only choice, then you can use them.  


## WHAT DO I NEED TO DO NOW?

At the moment, follow the recommendations above. There is no known timeline yet for safe modules to be manufactured and thus available for replacements. There is no point in calling your dealer yet.

If you have a 2017-2019 and have not yet had the software update, get it done. This is for 2017-2019 only, 2022 already has this, 2020-2021 is not available yet. It adds an alarm that will go off if a fire is detected. This will give you several minutes more notice.  


## IS GM STILL DOING BUYBACKS AND/OR MSRP SWAPS?

They may still pursue buybacks depending on your local laws, however all MSRP swaps are stopped since there is a stop sale on all Bolts.  


## WHAT ARE THE DETAILS ON THE FIRES THAT HAVE OCCURRED?

[I maintain a list with all the publicly known details](https://electrek.co/2021/07/28/everything-we-know-about-the-chevy-bolt-ev-fires/). I have also interviewed many of the owners to have first-hand information on the situations.

# HOW DOES THE FIRE PROGRESS?

Each fire is different, but the battery first will produce copious amounts of smoke. This will last for at least 15 minutes possibly up to an hour before fire erupts. The most likely spot for fire to erupt is under the rear seat due to the metal shell of the battery and that's where a plastic fuse holder is located. Once fire erupts, the car will be engulfed within a few minutes if not drowned in water.  


# WHAT IF THAT'S UNACCEPTABLE?

You have several options available:

* If you are still concerned, or need help, contact GM's concierge line at 1-833-EVCHEVY.
* Other numbers: 1-800-333-0510 or 1-819-994-3328 to speak with a defect investigator.
* **You can be get a loaner vehicle or a rental car at GM's expense and they will store your Bolt - just call them.** 
* You can also request a buyback via the concierge line. This is also available to lessees.

&#x200B;

# WHAT CAN US CANUCKS DO?

* Call GM Canada at 1-800-263-3777 ou en Francais 1-800-263-7854.
* Alternate GM Canada customer care center at 1-800-GM-DRIVE (1 800 463-7483)

&#x200B;

It‚Äôs an absurd amount of driving even in a Gas car. We are young and have driven gas cars (and a bicycle once) across the US numerous times. 

Several observations:

1. This trip was planned completely and utterly around charging stations. Charging stations dominated where we went and our schedule. However, when you‚Äôre driving this far in a short period of time, what else are you to do. We picked restaurants and parks and things to see and do within walking distance of chargers. 
2. It was fun and novel and even thrilling to  attempt to make it in this slow charging EV. It added to the trip greatly. That said, we are already a bit fed up and ready to sell this car (PM me, 2023 Bolt EV 1LT 22,000 miles. Pittsburgh area. Dog. Non smokers. Would detail dog hair) and upgrade to a faster charging car with a heat pump because as you can see we drive a lot. 
3. This would be utterly impossible in cold weather 
4. Had we done this in 12 or 13 days instead of 10 I think the amount of time we actually were sitting there waiting for the car to charge would have been around 0. With this trip length we did finally get into that mode on the last two days doing 1000 miles per day racing back home. But for the first 8 days we almost NEVER were waiting for the car to charge. More often than not we were like oh man the car is already charged plenty let‚Äôs get back. Having a dog and picking chargers with cool stuff nearby probably added to this. 
5. When it‚Äôs like 65-80 degrees the car likes to charge around 50-55kw
6. When it‚Äôs into the 80‚Äôs or near 90‚Äôs you‚Äôll hear the fan in the front turn on and the battery coolant on the right side of the hood begins pumping. In this mode, we found popping the hood allows the heat to dissipate more and the charge rate increase. 
7. Many chargers will just give you 38-42kw for no apparent reason when they‚Äôre capable of much more
8. Getting a free full level 2 charge at a hotel each night on your road trip makes it so much better.

So I called on Saturday and set up a test drive today (Monday) and get me a trade in value. As I'm walking over to the bolt, I stop and glance at the sticker and they have pasted on the sticker (+$5,000 market adjustment). I asked what this was, since it wasn't online in their ad and they told me to look again, and it was now shown online. So sometime between my call Saturday and lunchtime today they added $5k to each bolt.  

I didn't even get in I just said, ""if this is non negotiable, then it's not worth wasting either of our time"". He said no, so then we walked back to the service center where they were appraising my car and I just went home.

BLUF: Battery will be replaced. Dealership has no estimated arrival time for the replacement battery.

The vehicle was towed to a local dealership and they disconnected the 12V battery. When the technician later evaluated the car, he determined a battery replacement would be the best solution. Additionally, GM sent out an engineer yesterday and the engineer also recommended replacing the battery.

As for the cause, I am waiting for more detailed information. It‚Äôs possible that this was caused by a battery cell issue. This seems to line up with what u/redgrandam [said](https://www.reddit.com/r/BoltEV/comments/13dtqxx/comment/jjmivl1/), u/vidman56 [said](https://www.reddit.com/r/BoltEV/comments/13dtqxx/comment/jjm95yr/), u/teleke [said](https://www.reddit.com/r/BoltEV/comments/13dtqxx/comment/jjpbc8n/) and others.

Chevy automatically opts all Bolt owners into their ""Smart Driver"" service that tracks your driving behaviors (speeding, hard braking, hard acceleration, etc.). Per multiple users on the Bolt forums, this data is then sold to a data aggregator called LexisNexis, which then sells this information to insurance companies. Given that a majority of insurance providers use LexisNexis, it's a pretty safe bet that your insurance company would happily use this type of data to increase your premiums.

Mind you, this was NOT from a GM-internal report, it was one of those companies that do credit reporting and the like.  So GM must be sharing this.

1. Log in to the myChevrolet app
2. Go to **More**

4. Here you can see all the stuff that's tracked *and shared*.  On top, there's a **Driving Activity** drop-down that doesn't immediately look like a drop-down.  Click that, and **Enrollment Settings**
5. Ignore the ""Program Overview"" thing that tries to justify it's creepy existence.  Well, I guess you can look if you want.  But be sure to tap **Unenroll**
6. Pick a reason (I chose **Other** because there is no ""this is creepy AF"" option) and click **Unenroll** again

They say that‚Äôs how everyone works. I know I should just pay at this point, but I am really thinking about walking away on principal! I will be complaining to GM about this. This is shitty behavior!

They have been careful to not put anything in writing.  I am starting to think I should have been recording all my calls!

I have never bought a new car before, always used cars since my few brushes with dealers have been so bad. Been looking at EUVs for about nine months on and off and had pretty much given up until Friday :(

<Just needing to vent>

<Edited to add>
Thank you all for the advice and support.  I am back home after this ordeal without the car.  They already have sold the car to someone else.  I still don't know what my payment was for, but it's non-refundable, and they are saying I refused to accept delivery of the car and sign the paperwork.

It turns out one of the initial calls was recorded since I called from an office phone and all our work phone calls are recorded (is this the only time big brother works in the little guys favor?)

I can't really say more at this point in time.  We will be sending them a letter by the end of the week.

I made some recent mistakes.

Mistake 1: I bought the enhanced autopilot for $6000 on my new Model Y.

If you are going to get a Tesla, don't buy it. Just don't. At the very least, you can rent it on a monthly subscription that you can cancel anytime. The only thing it does over the standard autopilot is it has this click to change lane feature. Neat, but not worth $6000. No, there is no auto-park, with it anymore. Nor is there a summons feature anymore. Maybe they will come back. Maybe they will not.

Also Tesla, if someone pays an extra $6000 for an enhanced autopilot, how about one that DOESN'T ACTIVATE THE FUCKING WIPERS EVERY TIME. In autopilot, Tesla requires that the wipers be in auto. Of course, on a clear, dry windshield, auto should be equivalent to off. Sadly, that doesn't seem to be the case on mine. I called support and they simply said ""this is a known issue. There is no ETA for a fix."" No refunds allowed on the autopilot.

Mistake 2: I bought a Tesla. Don't get me wrong, there are a number of things I love about the car. But, combines with the wiper issue, and the fact that occasionally (and I mean at least every other day on my work commute) the car chooses to drastically decelerate when on autopilot. That's just downright dangerous.

I had some minor gripes about some other things they told me would be included but are not.

But I still wanted some sort of venue to air my grievances and suggest that maybe people who want a smart electric vehicle shouldn't pay to become Tesla beta-testers.

I wish I had waited to test drive an Ariya or something like that. My 5 year old Nissan's auto pilot was better than the Tesla's is right now.

Follow up: based on comments from another posting, comments which at *least* gave advice beyond ""wait for a software bug fix"" that Tesla gave me, the problem still exists.  Also, someone (or some bot) downvoted it, well, from 10 to 0.  I don't care about karma, but I do want exposure on this.  I find interesting that either a bot sought out such a post to downvote it, or there are just some Tesla fans that are unwilling to acknowledge the faults in the product (that may or may not exist for you) and the total apathy and lack of support from Tesla.

There's 2 chargers at the location.. and about 10 of us who share.. but now we sometimes we're sharign one because of him..  which means often no charger is available.

So I made a native iOS app that does exactly that, and also shows your electricity consumption per day and per hour for the past 30 days without having to wait for the bill to be issued. By checking the rolling 30 days costs you can tell whether you're spending more or less.

I thought I'd share the link here in case any other Octopus customers fancy giving it a spin. It's free for now, but I was thinking to put it at ¬£0.99 in a month or two.

Also - in regards to the credentials, the app doesn't store or send your octopus credentials anywhere, it logs in in the background, gathers your API key (you need to generate it before using the app), your MPAN and serial number, and then stores those values instead.

&#x200B;

Passed my driving test yesterday and am trying to work out the best thing to do but...lack of experience, y'know?  


My initial thought was plug in hybrid, but considering the government's stance on phasing out petrol/diesel new purchases I didn't know if it was prudent to just go all in on Electric. I've been eyeing up the Nissan Leaf (2017 model, not E+). There's a couple of things holding me back though:  


1) No personal charging point - Live in a block of flats without a personal charging point, though the supermarket next door and my work place both have charging points so I guess it isn't a massive issue? Have any of you been in this situation?  


2) Friends in distant lands - I have close friends up in Newcastle (I'm in the south so roughly 300 miles) so would be using that car to visit them. I'm assuming this would be a charge at the half way mark for an hour or two. It wouldn't be every weekend but I wouldn't want it to hamper me if I did want to visit them over the quick-fill of a plug in hybrid. Does anyone make long distance journeys on the regular?   


3) Journeys abroad - I have a big grand plan to drive over to Bled in Slovenia, but the fear that I won't be able to charge the car is worrying. I understand that it's not built for those kinds of journeys so it would need to be a ""Drive 200 miles, charge, relax in some town somewhere, drive another hundred, sleep for the night, drive another hundred in the AM, charge and relax for lunch, etc"" scenario, but if anyone has experience on major road trips and foreign charging that'd be good just so that I know what to expect.  


4) mains charging - am I right in assuming most electrics can charge off generic three pin plugs? So if I, say, visited family 100 miles away I could sling a cable inside and charge up while I visit them and then drive home end of day okay without having to hit up a specific charging points?   


5) With public EV charging points (as in on [https://www.zap-map.com/live/](https://www.zap-map.com/live/)) does the network matter? Is it just the connection you have to worry about? How panicky do you have to get when you hit 25% power when it comes to looking at the map and trying to marry up your car's connection to nearby points?

&#x200B;

I'm sorry if a lot of this has been answered elsewhere, I'm just not in the know about cars in general and don't want to mess this up. I'm spending time looking for answers, but anecdotal information allows me to also go and look up specific things as well and increase my base knowledge of electric cars.

We don't have any NEED for a car. We live in Cambridge and have got by fine on foot and bike for many years. The purpose would primarily be to explore further afield (within ~90 mile radius, to places where we can't easily/affordably get by train).

Budget is ¬£550/mth, plus charge cost.

Can't charge at home because no off-street parking and can't always be monitoring the cable on the footpath. However, there appear to be numerous chargers nearby us, within 15 minute walk (ranging from 5-15minute walk, maybe a dozen devices with 2 or more chargers).

Our usage pattern will likely be longer weekend journeys, up to 90 miles, 180 return, and let's say 1-2 additional journeys of 5 miles or less per week.

Had been looking at Onto a few mths ago, but now I see they've failed. Elmo and Ezoo stick out as alternatives, but the lack of the charge card on these services (whereas onto provided a card that worked with a nearby charging device) means more cost risk to me. I'm only slightly concerned about the charging cost; more concerned about the uncertainty of that cost.

The other uncertainty for me is damage fees. I have third party excess insurance. I had learned that Onto worked by 28 day contracts meaning it sat within the third party excess policy limits of max 28 day hires. I don't know about how other subscription companies work. I am hugely concerned about the uncertainty brought by any damage claims, and want to be confident that any insurance claims will be covered. I acknowledge this concern might be outside the interests of this sub, but putting it out there anyways, in case there's experience and insight to share.

Any advice for me on this plan of mine?",,,ElectricCarUK,"EV Subscription, Advice",1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/ElectricCarUK/comments/1745l6h/ev_subscription_advice/

With their environmental benefits, reduced operating costs, and impressive performance, it's no wonder that EVs are gaining traction worldwide. Yet, at the heart of every electric car's capabilities lies a silent hero ‚Äì the Battery Management System (BMS).

 EVs are only as good as their batteries, and the BMS is responsible for ensuring that these batteries have long and healthy lives. It continuously monitors and manages the state of charge, temperature, and voltage of individual cells within the battery pack. By preventing overcharging, over-discharging, and keeping the battery within an optimal temperature range, the BMS extends the battery's lifespan, reducing the need for premature replacements.

My thinking is that since is not often I do more than 30 miles in a day and I have a charger at home I could get something like the Peugeot 408 hybrid and be filling electric most of the time but when ever I choose to make a long drive I would have the back up of an IC engine.

I guess the other option is to look at long range vehicles since my current ev is advertised at 200 and I‚Äôm not seeing cars such as the facelift model 3 with up to 425mils but I‚Äôm not sure the extra prices if worth it if I‚Äôm only doing long drives every couple of months.

This is a post about a complete lack of customer service. 

I preordered a Model 3 LR three months ago. I was given a delivery window of Mid November to mid December. I got a message last week saying it was my turn to pick up my car. Sweet. They give me a choice of three days on their website to pick up the car. November 24, 25, 26. I find it a bit odd that thanksgiving they are open but I'm working on the 24th and the 26th and on such short notice I can't get out of work. So I put down delivery for the 25th. After all other stores are open on thanksgiving and the site blacked out other dates. 

I get messages from Tesla that I need to get my car insurance and pay the down payment or I won't be able to get the car. No problem. 

I pay the down payment via their app and get the insurance. I upload the proof to their app. All good. 

Then yesterday on 11/22/2021 I get a phone call at 3 pm saying that I can no longer pick up the car on 11/25 because they aren't actually open. 

Uh ok. So you tell me this after I put down the down payment and pay for the insurance. I'm a little pissed at this point but I get it. Let me pick it up another day then. And why didn't you tell me sooner?

They would only let me pick the 24th or 26th. That's it. I asked them can I pick up the car on December 2nd because I have work and can't reschedule or get someone to cover me on such short notice. Their response is ""no, we can't hold the car that long. We will give your car to someone else and you can wait another 3-4 weeks for another car to come in.""

The heck? They made the mistake. Took my money. Made me buy insurance for a car that I don't actually have and then they try to bully me into a specific delivery date on short notice? That's not fair. 

To make matters worse I try to post my story to r/teslamotors and it gets automatically deleted. I appealed it to a mod and he says ""This is not high quality content.""

Excuse me? I've never had such piss poor customer service from any car brand as I have had with this Tesla buying experience. 

I then say: ""Are we not allowed to criticize Tesla here? How much stock do you own?""

The mods response was ""How many days do you want to be banned?""

The ‚Äúashamed‚Äù part, however, stems from the leader of the organization.

2. Which parts will I need service on and how often? The car salesman mentioned a box with gears in it. What is this and will I receive a warning with an indicator when I need to change gear? 

3. Can I accelerate and brake with one pedal as I do today with my electric car?

4. Do I get fuel back when I slow down or drive downhill? I assume so, but need to ask to be sure. 

5. The car I test drove seemed to have a delay from the time I pressed the accelerator pedal until it began to accelerate. Is that normal in petrol cars?

6. We currently pay about 1.2p per mile to drive our electric car. I have heard that petrol can cost up to 10 times as much so I reckon we will lose some money in the beginning. We drive about 20,000 miles a year. Let's hope more people will start using petrol so prices go down.

7. Is it true that petrol is flammable? Should I empty the tank and store the petrol somewhere else while the car is in the garage? 

8. Is there an automatic system to prevent gasoline from catching fire or exploding in an accident. What does this cost?

9. I understand that the main ingredient in petrol is oil. Is it true that the extraction and refining of oil causes environmental problems as well as conflicts and major wars that over the last 100 years have cost millions of lives? Is there a solution to these problems?

10..I have heard that cars with internal combustion based engines are being banned to enter more and more cities around the world, as it is claimed that they tend to harm the environment and health of their citizens?? Is that true??

I drive a 2023 EV6 and have been an EV enthusiast for years so I know that if I want the most efficient charging experience I should use the 350kw units. As I pulled in I see a beautiful 2023 BMW iX on the 150 unit with the chademo plug with the hypercharger stalls open. I pulled into my 350 and (surprise) charged on 1st attempt at full max speeds. 

The woman in the iX was on the phone and appeared very frustrated. She then got in her car and moved to the 350 next to me. She then tried multiple times to get it to work, using her app, her credit card, and eventually broke down in tears because she couldn't figure it out. Her husband has been on the phone and was yelling at her because she couldn't figure it out. I stepped over and offered to help her out. She was flustered but agreed to let me try to help her. I had her unplug and reset her EA app. Within 5 minutes I had her charging. She was essentially doing things in the wrong order and the station was timing out every time. She had been trying to charge for over 30 minutes, had trued all the stalls and couldn't figure it out.

I bring this all up to remind the folks in this sub that we need to be the facilitators of change and help anyone we see having issues getting their cars to charge. Many of the new EV owners don't really know what they're doing, and having a negative experience on their 1st charging session not at home can impact their longterm views on EVs. Be kind and help these folks whenever possible.",,,electricvehicles,Be kind to new EV owners,0.97,https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/138tm52/be_kind_to_new_ev_owners/

Nothing ever gets done. And most times they just ignored my emails, so I gave up and just started thinking of it as a privilege that‚Äôs not owed to me since it‚Äôs free. 

But I just can‚Äôt get over the fact people park their gas vehicles there despite the sign that says ‚ÄúEV CHARGING ONLY‚Äù. These people are inconsiderate and park there because they know it‚Äôs not enforced. It‚Äôs disrespectful.

I am in an area of the US where  fast chargers are few and far between, and EVs are still somewhat a novelty (I am the only one  that I know that owns one -even counting Teslas).

EV Charger Plug fire - be careful! (Input requested. Link to pics below). 

Dodged a full house fire last night. Outlet completely melted. Fire burned casing and wall, but went out on its own. 

Equipment:
- Siemens versicharge 240/30A plugged into a NEMA 6-50 in a drive under garage. 
- Dedicated line with 40A fuse
- Professionally installed during home construction.  

Events:
- Charged friends MS 100D for 8 hrs during the day
- Charger rested for 1.5 hrs
- Plugged in a MS 75 to top off for the evening
- MS charged for a few hours then breaker tripped

Next morning I go out to find this near catastrophe. 

Very scary. Melted box, all wood is charred. 

Curious if I need to replace the entire wire (which is run through about 50 feet of walls in my house). 

I read that EV chargers should be hardwired to avoid fault points like a plug. 

Also read that most NEMA plugs aren‚Äôt intended to handle current for long periods of time (designed for a few hours running a dryer). 

Electricians coming tomorrow. 

Welcome any comments about how to protect myself in the repair/ reinstallation. 

I‚Äôm likely going to hardwire the charger (no plug) and look into adding a temperature sensor or something - and definitely a fire sensor.

The fires start in the power terminal blocks, where the power and charging cables connect to the PC board. It appears that the screws holding the terminals to the block are either loose or cross threaded, such that the terminals are not making solid contact with the power block. The result is that the terminal block and the PC board experience high heat, resulting in melting and smoke. PCB smoke is very nasty and potentially toxic to breathe.

My recommendation is that if you have a Grizzl-E unit, disconnect it from power, open the unit, and verify that all of the power block screws are very tight. If you are not comfortable doing this yourself, have an electrician perform the work.

As of the end of Q3 2023, the 30 charging ‚Äúnetworks‚Äù operating in the USA have activated 33,415 chargers supporting either CCS or Tesla connectors across 6,346 stations.

During this decade the number of places to plug-in for DCFC has more than doubled, while the number of chargers has more than tripled.

CCS networks have deployed 11,846 chargers across 4,400 stations. Tesla though still dominates, having deployed 21,569 chargers across 1,946 stations, reflecting the fact that their stations are on average much larger.

(So far, the number of Tesla stations that support CCS remains insignificant, at 11. According to their data, 10 of them were enabled back in 2022. While recent media reports suggest that Tesla has very recently converted more stations, they have not yet reported them to NREL. See the ‚ÄúData Notes‚Äù section at the end of this post.)

&#x200B;

**Competitive Landscape**

Although we now have 30 DCFC ‚Äúnetworks‚Äù operating the USA, the industry remains quite concentrated. Just seven companies operate 92 percent of DCFCs and 96 percent of the stations. Of course, the dominant player in the market is Tesla, with 65 percent of the DCFCs and 31 percent of the stations.

Both Tesla and ChargePoint are pushing ahead. In fact, over the past four quarters, ChargePoint added more stations than Tesla, making it the second largest network in the USA.

Electrify America fell to number three in terms of stations, falling behind ChargePoint as its own growth slowed at the same time that ChargePoint's accelerated. eVgo is gaining on Electrify America but still holds the number four position, followed by Shell Recharge, FCN, and EV Connect.

When counting chargers - a proxy for vehicle capacity - we get a different picture of the leaders. While ChargePoint is rolling out a lot of stations most of them support a single car. As a result, Electrify America continues its wide lead in CCS chargers, with their stations having a median size of 4 chargers each. Of course Tesla dominates due to their comparatively large stations, having a median size of 8 chargers each.

**Newcomers and Laggards**

Newcomers to the market over the past year: Rivian Adventure, 7 Charge Up (aka, 7-Eleven), and Circle K. While there are other newcomers - ChargeUp, Revel, Livingston - at this point in time it is hard to describe them as true ‚Äúnetworks‚Äù when they have only one or two stations each.

On the other hand, growth from the FCN, EVCS, and ZEFNET networks have plateaued over the past three years.

**Are stations getting bigger?**

In a word, somewhat - if we are talking about CCS stations. The overwhelming majority of stations have four or fewer chargers. However we are seeing some improvements. Electrify America now has 59 stations with eight or more chargers; eVgo has 26 with eight or more chargers. 

Meanwhile, Tesla continues to upsize. They have 1,792 stations with 8 or more chargers and 339 with 16 or more chargers. Their biggest is - very big - with 84 chargers, opened on August 31.

**Data Notes**

Data source: My data comes from a public database of ""alternative fuel stations‚Äù hosted by the US Department of Energy‚Äôs National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL). It‚Äôs accessible via an API and is documented [here](https://developer.nrel.gov/docs/transportation/alt-fuel-stations-v1/all/). 

Note that the aggregate numbers captured by NREL database do not always exactly match those published by the EV networks on their own websites. Why? Beats me. For example, Electrify America seems to be quite slow with updating the total station and charger numbers reported on their own web site and the numbers alway differ from what they report to NREL on a regular basis.

I make a distinction between places to charge - a s*tation -* and DC Fast charges at a station. Counting stations is a bit of challenge because the companies are inconsistent in how they upload records to the NREL database. Some data records represent a single physical location and indicate the number of chargers at that address. Other records though might represent a single charger, with one record for each charger at the same address. Ideally I could simply roll up these addresses to form stations, except common location records do not always share the same representation of the street address. Example: ‚Äú71 East Grove St‚Äù vs. ‚Äú71 East Grove Stree‚Äù vs. ‚Äú71 East Grove Street‚Äù. Therefore I have to do some address standardization before aggregating.

Finally, I do not count CHAdeMO chargers since this technology is being phased out, or ‚Äúnon-networked‚Äù stations because most people would not use them on a regular basis. Typically these are car dealerships and/or are not accessible after business hours.

We have been discussing adding EV charging to one of our Charleston Station since the EV charging situation is terrible here. We were initially going to get a couple of 25kW units and call it a day but after doing some research we found that those probably wouldn't be the best solution since most EV's now have 75+ kWh packs. 

Our goal is to be able to provide at least 2 200kW to 350kW charging stations and up to 8 total if there is a system out there that provides some kind of load balancing, for instance 1mW site power shared between 8 chargers would allow a full station to charge at 125kW per car or half capacity to charge at 250kW per car. Again I am unsure if a system like that even exists other than the networks like Electrify America and EVgo but it would be a major plus so that we could offer more charging stalls.

The first site that is a good candidate does have 3 phase power and the grid transformer for the power is located very close to where the chargers would potentially go. We've talked with a few electricians although both told us that the tech didn't exist yet and probably wouldn't for the next 5 to 10 years and if it did it would probably cost millions to deploy, None the less we are still interested in finding a solution even if it's a few years out.

The website clearly showed my dealer‚Äôs selling price at MSRP with no after dealer markup. When I arrived at Sunrise on 7/30/22 to get my truck the Price Summary they gave me showed an additional $2780 for accessories that I didn‚Äôt order (LoJack, VIN etching or something).  They refused to remove these items or the extra charge. I asked if I could think about the new price for 24 hours and they said no. I asked if I could think about it for 12 hours and they said if I left that day without purchasing it they would sell it to someone else with a hefty markup. 

After more negotiating they said they would throw in certain add-ons for free (tinting, curb rash repair) as long as I agreed to leave a 5 star review after the sale. I didn‚Äôt agree to these terms but decided to proceed with the purchase with the extra $2780. 

I went to the financing manager where he then tried to placate me by saying he thought it was wrong for the dealer to tack on those features. I told him to not pretend that he was on my side because they could remove those charges and items if they wanted to. He then became very aggressive and got in my face saying that if I‚Äôm so upset I shouldn‚Äôt buy the truck. With consent from the Sales Manager, he refused to do the paperwork and I was told they would not be selling me the truck. 

Before leaving I told everyone there I was writing down their names and it would be in my review and letter to Ford corporate. The sales manager then said ‚Äúyou have my information but I have yours too. If I see my name in a review, something can happen‚Äù. When I asked if that was a threat, he said ‚Äútake it anyway you want‚Äù. 

I‚Äôve been a loyal Ford customer. My father bought his last truck from Sunrise and was planning on purchasing his next truck from them as well. I hope the $2800 hidden markup was worth losing two customers and tarnishing Ford‚Äôs reputation. Their behavior was utterly shameful.  

Direct to consumer can‚Äôt come soon enough. 

TLDR: The dealership was looking for any reason not to sell me the truck close to its MSRP so they could sell it to someone else at a premium.  They‚Äôre trash.

But between California‚Äôs fluctuating gas prices, and my wife‚Äôs desire to drive to multiple stores daily, I began looking into getting her an EV back in November, to compensate for the gas.  A few hours later she drove off smiling, with a brand new 2023 Lightning XLT (Avalanche color).  
Over the next month and a half we had traveled from CA to Vegas two times (visiting family), took a Disneyland trip, and traveled plenty of miles around town.
Over three thousand miles later, I realized my own beloved diesel was spending more and more time in the garage, while I was taking every opportunity to borrow the truck I had purchased for my wife.
This brought me to January 4th of this year.  While finally driving my diesel truck on a short trip, I happened to pass by my local Ford dealership, and noticed a beautiful gray 2023 XLT Lightning sitting on the lot.
And well, just like that day back in November, I again was sitting in the dealership for a few hours.
But this time, wearing a huge smile, I was the one driving off the lot, enjoying my own brand new LightningüòÅ.  
Now with two amazing trucks, my wife can now enjoy hers, and I can stop finding ways to take her truck on my daily joy rides.  
For those on the fence, and hesitant on getting into the realm of EV‚Äôs, I‚Äôve been there.  And although I can‚Äôt speak for every brand or model, I can say without a doubt, the Ford Lightning‚Äôs are amazing.

To begin, I've been a giant Tesla fan for about a decade. Shortly after the Model S came out, although I was skeptical of EV's, I had an opportunity to test drive a Model S and I was hooked. I stretched and got a used Model S in 2015. I Absolutely loved the car, as it was so ahead of its time and so much fun to drive. I drove that car until last September, when the battery developed a leak and got water in it. 

I was a day two Cybertruck reservation holder (it took me a day to get over the shock of the look of it) and was really looking forward to getting one. The specs, price, performance, stainless steel, etc. offered a lot to look forward to, and I couldn't wait for it. Since I needed to replace my old S, I got a long range Model Y. 

I live in a rural area in PA, which tends to get our share of winter weather. When they treat the roads around here, they lay antiskid (very small gravel) on thick. Shortly into winter, I noticed lots of chips and pitting on my Model Y, as a result of the aggressive rear door/fender flares. This progressively got to a point that it really drove me nuts and I decided I won't be happy seeing this beautiful car get destroyed every winter. 

So last week, tesla emailed me about finalizing my order for the Cybertruck, to the tune of $100k for the foundation series AWD. Comparing it to the Lightning, with the recent discounts, and my recent gripes with Tesla, I decided to just go ahead and trade the Y in on a Lightning Lariat. Got it for $58k and change, which is a bargain compared to the Cybertruck. 

So far, I love the ride. It's going to take some getting used to their range calculation (dynamic vs. tesla's flat mileage consumption rate) and it barely fits in my garage. In some ways this feels like a step back from Tesla, but in many ways the lightning feels more refined and feels like it's going to hold up much better over time.

To be clear, I actually liked the design. And I'm a strong proponent of Tesla otherwise; I own a 2023 Model 3 RWD. Fantastic car and I'd recommend it all day every day.

But the 'stainless steel exoskeleton' got reduced to just be a tough outer skin, with the only 'bulletproof' component being the doors, and only on some models. 

The price turned out to be almost twice as much, with less range than they announced. 

The upper control arms look sketchy as hell. 

It doesn't have CCS support currently, or even basic Autopilot. Musk himself has even stated that because the Cybertruck is low volume right now, they're not even focusing on getting that or FSD working on the Cybertruck, so who knows how long it will be software stunted for.

And even their 4680 structural battery pack isn't anything to write home about; with the charging curve falling off a cliff at 25% and the weight/range being on par or just *slightly* better than competing EV trucks.

No onboard air compressor like they originally announced; no spare tire, and if you buy one, it has to be kept in the truck bed, which kinda kills your storage space. 

The unique shape also means you can't use a majority of the existing camping products, as I plan on using my truck for a lot of camping & light-duty overlanding. 

Their 48v LV architecture, while I understand why they did it from a manufacturing perspective, does not matter to me as a consumer--all I see are limitations in repairs.

The frunk doesn't hold a candle to the F150 Lightning.

Even the steer-by-wire system, while I don't doubt its reliability due to redundant systems, is probably an overall net-loss for offroading as you lose the tactile feedback on the steering wheel from what your wheels are doing.

The only things it has going for it that I like are the NEMA 14-50 in the bed, the built-in tonneau cover, and native access to the Supercharger network. But I feel like that's not enough to overcome the negatives.

I don't think the Cybertruck as an idea is bad, or that it was doomed to fail. It just fails to live up to expectations, or do anything really useful to make it worth it. Tesla might have stood a chance if they retained first-mover advantage in the EV truck space; but for the first time, they trailed behind the competition and the alternatives are actually pretty decent/better.

I'd have liked to have gotten a Rivian R1T, but it's a bit too far out of my price range. It would be more suited for the type of adventuring & exploration I want to do with the truck, but the F150 Lightning still ticks all the right boxes for me. The only thing that concerns me is the low ground clearance because of how low the motors hang.

Anyways. Looking at an XLT extended range towards the end of this year.

Long story short, I pre-ordered an R1T waaaay back at the start and the Calgary delivery center finally opened up on Feb 1st. I made my appointment to go test drive then be matched with my R1T. In the time between my preorder and now I decided to buy a Lightning to tide me over as my other EVs had ruined me for driving gas vehicles. I had always expected to just transfer the Lightning to my company and keep the R1T for my personal use. 

Well, fast forward to yesterday and I drive up to the Rivian center and my wife and I take an absolutely GORGEOUS Forest Green R1T for a test drive. The last time I had driven an R1T was about a year ago in Las Vegas but that was a rushed affair. As expected, the R1 was brutally fast and nice to drive. But it was all the other things that you use on a daily basis that started adding up. The cupholders in the front (only two of them, no bottle pocket in the door) are the pop-out variety. No glove compartment at all. The center console is partially used up by the stupid little bluetooth speaker thing. The rear seat only has cupholders in the fold down part between the two outer seats. Which is where I'll be sticking my youngest kid's car seat since it doesn't fit rear-facing in the outboard positions. The infotainment system only has TuneIn (who the hell uses that?), Spotify and Amazon Prime music. No Audible, no Pandora, no Apple Music/Podcasts, no YT Music. So I'd be stuck using my phone over bluetooth like I was back in 2001 with an aftermarket head unit in my late 90s Accord. 

Want to adjust the mirrors? All in sub-menus in the center screen. Adjust steering wheel position? You guessed it, center screen. Vent position? Center screen. Want to engage child safety locks on the rear windows? Center screen. Wrong phone connected first for driver seat/mirror settings? Tap Rivian icon, tap username, select proper user. Why not just have a goddamn button for position 1/2/3 like Ford? These are all things I used multiple times a drive with my family in the vehicle. 

Then we get to the rest of the vehicle. The truck has a single 1400W inverter for all the outlets. That's kind of pathetic when my utility trailer has a 4000W inverter that I bought from Canadian Tire for less than $500 on sale. I've taken my Lightning camping a few times now during fire bans and having power available for a kettle to boil water and a two burner hot plate to cook on has been awesome. Either one of those things would max out the Rivian's entire power system. Not to mention I have a transfer switch in my garage that allows me to run 4 critical 120V circuits off a 20A 120V (2400W) generator. Can't do that with a max of 1500W but the frunk outlets in my Lightning can and have. 

The tonneau cover? What a stupid design that is. I have a soft roll up one on my Lightning beacuse I just use it to keep snow/water off stuff. But even a tri-fold or metal roller is easy to use. Just unlock, roll or flip them up and they're out of the way. Rivian's? Slide the individual panels out, fold them up and stow them in the gear tunnel. What a pain in the ass. 

Then we get to the wheels and tires. Rivian has decided to go with a +38 offset 5x5.5 inch bolt pattern 8.5"" wide wheel with a 33"" tire diameter. The 20"" option uses the same size tires as an F150 with 20's and the 22"" wheel uses the same size as a F150 with 22's. Lots of tire options. But - and here is the rub - the 22"" wheels don't come with a spare and the 20"" wheels MUST BE SPECCED AS PART OF THE ALL TERRAIN PACKAGE. That means to get 20"" wheels you will be spending $5100 extra in Canada and to get the 22's you'll be spending $2500 plus another $1000 for a spare. The 21"" wheels that are standard require a 275/55R21 tire and also do not come with a spare. There is ONE tire in that size and it is the OEM Rivian shitty highway tire. No winter tires, no all weather tires, no AT tires. Nothing. So if you want to drive your $100k Rivian on anything other than bare dry warm pavement you are looking at a MINIMUM of $5000 extra for wheels and tires.

Then we get to the NVH issues. Had I driven there in my brother's Mercedes GLE AMG or my old 2021 Ranger, I would have been like ""this is normal"". But, I drove there in my Lightning and the road noise, motor noise and wind noise were frankly shockingly bad in comparison.

Yeah, long story short. I thought I would be leaving the Lightning family yesterday before I went to drive the Rivian. I don't really need the full size truck. I don't haul any huge cargo. My family and I are all normal-sized humans so we don't need crazy legroom. But the simple things we use every time we drive just aren't there in the Rivian. And as much as I'd like to picture myself an intrepid overlander driving places no mortal truck could ever hope to reach - I'm just a late 30's guy that has 2 small kids, runs a pair of small-medium sized companies and has no time for epic off road adventures.

TL;DR - The R1T would have sold me immediately if I didn't have the Lightning to compare it to side by side.",,,F150Lightning,TIFU by driving my Lightning to go pick up my R1T,0.88,https://www.reddit.com/r/F150Lightning/comments/1ah91vc/tifu_by_driving_my_lightning_to_go_pick_up_my_r1t/

Been looking at an EV truck for years.

My brain knew the Platinum wasn‚Äôt worth $14k over and ER lariat, objectively. But I loved the interior on the Platinum and told myself no part of an EV truck purchase is a frugal decision, no reason to penny pinch now‚Ä¶

I love this truck, I do. I bought it on Saturday and already logged 250 miles but still trying to silence the cheap part of my brain that hates spending money on anything. Could use some hype up from anyone who wants to share stories.

We left our house at a 80% charge, due to cold it estimated the range to be 180 miles.

Our first stop is an IKEA 62 miles away. We arrive with 30.. miles of estimated charge. That's right, on a 62 mile flat highway run we lost 150 miles of charge  (I drove 80 most of the way). We drive around town and don't find a vanity.

On our way out we hit a fast charger (get the full 150kw/hr). Charge the car up to 65%, took like 20 minutes, left with an estimated 160 miles. Arrived home with 20 miles of range left. i drove 70-74 this time.

My take aways: Unfortunately you need to account for the wind especially driving a big truck. Apparently we drove both directions in open fields into a 20-30 mi/hr wind. I attribute this to most of our range loss outside of me going 80. I was baffled at how big of an impact it made.

Winter weather sucks for EVs, the range loss, losing charge to due heat.

DC fast chargers and the ability to take a 150 kw/hr charge gives me hope for the ev world. It was crazy how fast we were ready to go.

[deleted],,,1663365250.0,,,xg45sb,,True,,,t3_xg45sb,39.0,,/r/KiaEV6/comments/xg45sb/comparison_between_kia_ev6_and_tesla_model_y/,,94,"In early July of 2021, I test drove and then put in an order for a Tesla Model Y Long Range. At the time I thought I‚Äôd get my car in November or maybe December. Instead, I took delivery of it in mid September of 2022. During that fourteen month wait, I had a chance to buy a Kia EV6 from my local dealer. Given that at the time I had no idea when Tesla might build my car, I test drove the Kia, liked it, and bought it. Now with two EVs in my garage, I have a chance to do my own back to back comparison between an Austin built Tesla Model Y Long Range and a Kia EV6 Wind with the Tech Package and AWD ‚Äî the winner stays and the other car gets sold.

When I put in my order for the Tesla, there were very few options for electric cars in Illinois with anything close to enough range for me. The Ford Mustang Mach E, Chevy Bolt, and the four Tesla models. Several EV cars from legacy car manufacturers were on the way in coming years and there might have been a few others available, just not in my state at that time. The Bolt didn‚Äôt have all wheel drive or very good DC fast charging ‚Äî later they got recalled for battery fires. The Mustang Mach E has never been particularly appealing to me and dealers were demanding extra charges for them even back then. I considered the Model 3 and Y ruling out the S and X due to price, going with the Y for the hatchback and claimed smoother ride quality.

Through the end of 2021 and first half of 2022, several additional EV options hit the US market, even in Illinois. I immediately liked the Hyundai Ioniq 5, Kia EV6, and Volkswagen ID.4 once they were officially announced. So I made inquiries at local dealerships. It came as a total shock to me when my local Kia dealer called in early February to say that they had a Kia EV6 on the lot with no reservation attached to it. This was at least five months earlier than I expected the Korean EVs to arrive in the midwestern US. I ended up buying it and at the time of this writing I have 13,000 miles on it. I think I have a pretty good sense of what the car is like to own and drive over short and longer distances in all kinds of weather.

My EV6 was my first electric car. Like most EVs, it has remarkable acceleration, a quiet drivetrain, and lots of the common electronic gizmos of modern cars. I think it is an attractive car, sporty looking and contemporary. Mine is a mid level spec for the range, a Wind with the Tech Package and AWD. So it doesn‚Äôt have a heads up display, the more advanced semi autonomous driver aids, or sunroof of the top trim model. It also has taller sidewall tires which I genuinely prefer for smoother ride quality. It has a touch screen but also has physical buttons to control various things in the car. From day one I was struck by how quiet and comfortable the car is. It is easily the quietest car I‚Äôve ever owned and among the smoothest in ride quality. Its EV driving characteristics are adjustable and I‚Äôve found a degree regenerative braking that I like. It is well built, designed, and put together. There were no flaws in the paint, bodywork, or trim. There were no squeaks or rattles when new and very few have developed in the past 13,000 miles. At the time it was eligible for the $7500 federal tax incentive making its actual cost to me less than $50,000 total.

I really like my EV6. The ventilated and heated front seats are great. I find that I use the ventilation feature often and on long drives I think it really helps maintain comfort. The layout of the controls is pretty good. I especially like that there is a little shelf below the touchscreen giving my hand a place to brace so that finger touches are more accurate even on a bumpy road. My passengers appreciate that the climate vents front and back are physical things that they can adjust at will. The rear seats are roomy and comfortable with tilting backs. There is plenty of headroom and legroom throughout the car. There are USB-C charging ports in the front and back, an interior 110 volt AC outlet, and a vehicle to load attachment to use the car‚Äôs to power port to run appliances, like for camping or in a power outage. 

Speaking of power, the car‚Äôs 77.4 kWh battery is enough to give it well over 200 miles of interstate highway range or close to 300 miles of lower speed mixed driving. It uses the CCS DC fast charging standard and mine came with 1000 kWh of free charging at Electrify America stations. If you can find the right charger and the battery is at the right temperature, the car can recharge really, really fast. But even at only 150 kWh, my charging stops on road trips are short. However, CCS is a liability at this time where I live and occasionally travel. There just aren‚Äôt enough charging stations and most of those that exist can only charge four cars at a time. I‚Äôve also found that Electrify America stations are often not fully operational, with 350 kWh equipment only putting out 125 kWh and some equipment completely non functional. I‚Äôm sure this will improve over time, but in 2022 road trips in the midwest can be extra stressful.

On September 13 of 2022 I finally had my appointment to take delivery of my Tesla Model Y. When I got to my nearest service center, I was the only customer there and my car was brought around right away. My inspection of the car found four issues, a chip in the paint, a misaligned front fender, a misaligned door, and taillights that had different gaps on the right and left. The service manager took the car in back to sort these out and I finished my paperwork. It took quite some time to fix the car but it was eventually brought back around for me to finish the set up, phone pairing, etc. But I still couldn‚Äôt leave because something went wrong with the servers and my car stayed in service mode which required another long wait while that got sorted. Lest it sound like I‚Äôm super unhappy about all of that, this was still a good buying experience and still shorter than any I‚Äôd done at a conventional dealership.

Eventually I was able to start my hour and a half trip home. The car was paired to my phone as its key. All the controls were adjusted for me. I had created a driver profile for me and a guest profile too. I‚Äôd selected some apps to go in the ‚Äúdock‚Äù area at the bottom of the screen. Saved a couple of radio presets, so time to hit the road. I‚Äôd already test driven a Model Y the previous summer, so I knew what to expect with one pedal driving. As soon as I was under way I couldn‚Äôt help but notice all the squeaks and rattles coming from the interior of the car. I made my way via surface streets and towards the interstate as the car worked on calibrating its cameras so the various systems like cruise control would start working. 

I stopped for lunch and the doors locked on their own when I walked away. That‚Äôs a nice touch and I wish my Kia had that feature. Instead I have to either fish out the key fob or firmly press the door handle in just the right way for the doors to lock ‚Äî which sometimes takes a couple of tries. Unlocking was the same easy matter on the Tesla and again better than my Kia which requires the same routine as locking it. I prefer the Tesla door handles, but both cars are ridiculous. I wish they had something more conventional. Starting the Tesla is really just getting in. My Kia has a start button and start up screen on the dash, which is fine. I‚Äôm just pointing out a difference. 

Parking and backing up my Model Y for the first time produced some more comparisons. The Tesla has better views looking out the side or front, but the Kia has better views out the back and through the mirrors. That giant Tesla screen only devotes half an inch more to its rear view camera display than the Kia EV6. The Tesla camera resolutions are no better than the various cameras on my Kia and some are worse. For example, the EV6 blind spot side cameras are much better than the Tesla. My Kia has a 360 degree surround view and multiple camera angles to aid parking. Despite its many cameras, Tesla offers less for the driver. A few years ago, Tesla may have had a huge advantage in the market, but they are being overtaken.

Finally on the interstate and pointed home, I tried the cruise control. OK, it makes needless ‚Äúboing‚Äù sounds. The computer simulation display of what‚Äôs going on around me is a neat gimmick, though I question it‚Äôs usefulness. Later, I engaged the auto steering. Yep, it keeps the car centered in the lane, just like my Kia, but it nags the driver way more. The Kia needs slight steering input less often, especially on the interstate. The Tesla seems to need something every 12 seconds but not too much or it will shut off ‚Äî it is touchy. The Tesla auto steering doesn‚Äôt like construction any more than the Kia and the visualization of the construction cones is amusing.

My drive home was around 60 miles of surface streets in two different cities, interstate between them, and a two lane rural highway for the last leg. On all of these surfaces the Tesla was noticeably louder than my Kia. Bumps hit harder and harsher which set off the various squeaks and rattles coming from all over the interior. Wind, road, and tire noise were louder and of a different character than the EV6, sharper and more echo-like probably because of the glass roof. The decibel measuring app on my phone confirms the Tesla is louder than my EV6. I set up a test later, driving the cars back to back at 60 MPH. The Tesla made 68.8 dB into the wind and 68.7 dB on the return with a tailwind. The Kia made 65.9 into the wind and 65.3 with a tailwind. 

I had six incidents on my trip home and several more since then of the cruise control or auto steering on the Tesla misbehaving. The Tesla sometimes insists the speed limit is much lower than actually is. I suspect it is reading road signs and mistaking route markers for speed limits, but no matter the cause it is irritating. The auto steering cancels sometimes for reasons I don‚Äôt understand, though I will accept that user error might be playing a role. Then there is the phantom braking‚Ä¶ in the first sixty miles it phantom braked three times for no perceptible reason and it has continued to do so nearly every time I drive it. It does this in auto steering and regular cruise control both. It actually seems worse in the day time than at night. Cresting a hill seems to be an aggravating factor. The Kia cruise control and lane centering are better. In 13,000 miles I‚Äôve had one instance of minor misbehavior in my EV6.

A thing about the Tesla cruise control that I like better than the Kia is in stop and go traffic. If the Kia comes to a stop, the driver must push a button or press the accelerator briefly to get the car moving again at which point the cruise takes over. The Tesla just goes when the car in front moves. That‚Äôs neat. Another Tesla advantage is that the auto steering and cruise control cancel together. On my EV6, they are separate systems, either one can run alone, and cancelling one does not cancel the other. I prefer the way Tesla does that because there is no circumstance where I want the auto steering without the cruise control.

The automatic high beam headlight control on the Tesla is garbage. It doesn‚Äôt want to switch to low beams, even when the oncoming traffic is really close. I had to take manual control every time to avoid blinding people on a two lane rural highway. Then it will switch to low beams for yard lights in houses I pass. I‚Äôve had or driven several cars with automatic high beam controls and all of them work much better than Tesla.

Side by side the Model Y is definitely larger than the Kia EV6. It is taller, longer, and wider. The Kia looks like a car to the Tesla‚Äôs SUV proportions. Both have comfortable seats with nice material. The Tesla heats all the seats, even the middle seat in the back. The Kia only heats the front but also ventilates them which is really nice. There is more head room in the Tesla and more room altogether in the back seat. Not that the EV6 is tight, but the Model Y does have more foot and head room in the back and more storage too. There is really no comparison in storage capacity, the Tesla has a big frunk, a big trunk, and a big area under the trunk. 

In the Model Y, so many things are in the touch screen. Climate controls including aiming the vents are in the touch screen, so are the windshield wipers, and most everything else. It is a nice screen, clear and responsive. The layout of menus is pretty good, like what one might expect from a good smartphone or tablet computer. The Tesla is very much a computer that you can drive. The Kia EV6 touch screen is much more automotive, functional but not as snazzy. Tesla‚Äôs dog mode is such a nice touch. I haven‚Äôt used it yet because I‚Äôm not letting my puppy in the Tesla unless I sell the Kia.

The smartphone app for Tesla is far better than what the Kia has. It does more. It shows more. It is better designed and most importantly it works. The Kia app has largely not worked for me three of the six months I‚Äôve owned the car. I have a service appointment to replace the modem in the hopes that improves things, but it might be a software issue instead or some kind of issue with the local cellular network. Based on my interactions with Kia over this, I can say they just aren‚Äôt a tech company in the way Tesla are.

I think the Tesla Model Y Long Range is faster than the Kia EV6 Wind. I don‚Äôt have a good means of testing that to the faction of a second, but by the seat of the pants the Tesla feels quicker. Its steering is quicker and sharper. Overall it has more of a sports car feel. My Model Y also came with the trailer hitch and modes in the software to easily turn off sensors and alarms if there is a bike rack mounted on the hitch. My Kia required an aftermarket hitch and every time it is parked each of the relevant safety systems have to be changed from the touchscreen. It is a pain, but I don‚Äôt haul my bike around all that often. 

The Tesla seems to be more efficient and over a short test of both cars back to back the Tesla got 3.64 miles/kWh or 275 Wh/mile and the Kia got 3.5 miles/kWh or 286 Wh/mile which is not a huge difference, but enough to give the Model Y more range. I‚Äôve seen averages of 4.1 or more miles/kWh (better than 250 Wh/mile) on the EV6 this summer, but I wanted to quote numbers from identical test drives. Good efficiency coupled with access to the Super Charger network and interior roominess makes the Tesla a better road trip car. There are far more Tesla fast charger stalls in the midwest than everything else combined and Tesla fixes their chargers if they break. There is a stall at an Electrify America station on a route I have used that has been broken down for months.

So which car am I going to keep and which one gets sold? I‚Äôm still evaluating, but I‚Äôll probably keep the Kia and sell the Tesla. To be sure the Model Y is a good EV and if I hadn‚Äôt had the EV6 first, I‚Äôd be satisfied with the Tesla. However, I value a quiet, comfortable ride quality and the Kia is far superior to the Tesla with its sports car ride and noisy interior. I also use cruise control a lot, most every mile I drive. The Tesla cruise control and lane keeping systems are frankly not very good. The Kia systems are good, do what I want them to do, and are trustworthy. I understand that people love the computer-that-you-drive experience of Tesla, but I prefer having real buttons and controls that I can use by feel without looking. Importantly, I can sell the Tesla for more than I paid for it and probably do so easily. 

I‚Äôve set the Model Y up with a tempered glass screen protector, all weather floor mats, a removable front plate bracket, under seat rear vent covers, and a mobile charger. Things I had researched long ago and should help keep the car in excellent condition. I‚Äôll drive it a bit but mostly it will remain parked in my garage with the battery at 50-80% until I get around to selling it once I have the title from the state, assuming I sell the Model Y and not the EV6.

Hi All,

My very plush, well-cared for 2012 F150 Platinum decided to check out and I needed a quick solution. I was caught unprepared and had not done any vehicle research (EV's or otherwise). The EV9 immediately caught my eye, but visits and calls to local dealerships were unproductive, as they currently have zero info on purchase/lease options (probably not in my budget anyway).

Long story short, I bought a 2022 EV6 FE on very short notice with minimal research. So far - WOW. Such a beautiful design and overall build quality is better than I expected from a KIA (just learning how far KIA has come in recent years). Not that I'll drive it this way much, but mashing the pedal in Sport mode is unreal. Oh yeah it also tows 2200 lbs? So cool.

### Leasing 101, thanks to [Leasehackr](https://leasehackr.com/blog/2015/9/19/8-things-you-should-know-before-leasing-a-new-car).

-	**Leasing is like paying for the depreciation** that occurs during your use of the vehicle. The monthly lease payment is calculated based on the car‚Äôs depreciation over the lease term.

-	**Some cars lease better than others.** Factors such as residual value, money factor, and cash incentives affect the lease cost. High residual value, low money factor, and generous cash incentives are desirable. You can lease an EV6 at ok price but be aware you are paying more than 8% in interest.

-	**Lease prices can be negotiated.** The selling price of a car, which affects the lease cost, is determined by individual dealers and is not set by the manufacturer. The more discount you get, the better, the lower your buyout.

-	**Be cautious of marked-up rates and fees.** Dealers can mark up the money factor, acquisition fee, and disposition fee, potentially increasing the lease cost. [Edmunds forums](https://forums.edmunds.com/discussion/69045/kia/ev6/2023-kia-ev6-lease-deals-and-purchase-prices/p2) has the latest Money Factor and Residual for all the different terms. [Leasehackr](https://leasehackr.com/rate-findr) also has a paid option to pull this data for yourself at any time. A dealer cannot change the Residual but they can markup the rate. Knowing that they are could be used as a bargaining chip to get a larger MSRP discount.

-	**When leasing, someone else (the lessor) takes on the risk of depreciation.** The automaker sets the residual value, and any overestimation is their risk, not the lessee‚Äôs.

-	**Avoid making a down payment on a lease.** If the car is totaled or stolen, you may not get your down payment back. A down payment also obscures the cost of the lease.

-	**In a lease, Kia financial owns the car.** You are just ‚Äúrenting‚Äù the car. Your insurance company pays out to the owner = Kia. Insurance company doesn‚Äôt care what you paid for the down payment.

-	**A Down payment is not DAS (due at signing).** You can have $0 down payment but still pay fees, taxes, first month payment upfront.

### What does this have to do with a Kia EV6?

-	**Kia Financial is passing through $7500 as a rebate.** This [rebate is from the feds](https://irc.bloombergtax.com/public/uscode/doc/irc/section_45w), your tax dollars. As part of the IRA bill, corporations get $7500-$40,000 in tax credits with no limits for EV and Plug-in hybrids that they put on the road. In a lease, Hyundai is the owner of the car, hence they get the rebate, they are passing it through.

-	**This has no effect on your taxes.** There is no limit, you can get as many cars as you want.

-	**Before you ever approach a dealer, know what the numbers look like.** The [Leasehackr calculator](https://leasehackr.com/calculator) is invaluable for this.

-	**Negotiate MSRP.** You should not be going in targeting a monthly payment. Lower the MSRP, the lower your buyout. As data points, multiple people have sent me sheets where they got discounts ranging from $1000-$3000 on Wind RWD. [Example here](https://forum.leasehackr.com/t/2023-kia-ev6-wind-rwd-lr-674-22mo-15k-miles-and-674-das/467186?u=kellstar)

-	**Extra Fees:** Acquisition Fee is always $650. Documents fee, some states have caps on this, others don‚Äôt. Dealer fees can vary as well.

-	**Deal sheet** would look like [this](https://i.imgur.com/D1EY6zq.jpg). Feel free to send it to me as well to take a quick look.

-	**‚ÄùAgreed upon Value of the Vehicle‚Äù** - this is a line item and should Match MSRP. I know that dealers have added $3k to this line for a third-party warranty. So keep your eyes open.

-	**‚ÄùGross Capitalized Cost‚Äù** - This will be the MSRP with any extras you add. There should be a breakdown of what this is on another page. Typically it‚Äôs MSRP+Acquisition fee+ Document fees+ dealer fees but you could also choose to pay all the extras upfront instead of adding it to the total.

-	**Cap Cost Reduction** - part of the $7500 will be taxed and the rest will go to pay for any of the extras listed above and the remainder will apply to the actual MSRP. Again this can be structured differently depending on what you are paying for upfront.


**Most importantly, don‚Äôt let a dealer rush you or pressure you to sign something you don‚Äôt understand.**

### What about trade-ins?

I get the allure of trade-ins and some states offer tax credits too. However, I implore you to take a few minutes and go through [this list](https://forum.leasehackr.com/t/list-of-places-to-sell-or-value-your-car-online/396451) with links to tons of places to sell your car. Run your car through a few of them before asking for dealers‚Äô trade-in. You would be surprised at $1000s you might be leaving on the table even after tax savings.

It‚Äôs entirely possible your dealer might match or beat these offers too.

### How do I do a buyout?

**Bad news first.**

Kia requires a dealership [to purchase the vehicle if it is garaged/registered in CO, DC, FL, HI, IN, PA, SD or SC.](https://owners.kia.com/content/owners/en/finance.html?page=finance&ssp=1&darkschemeovr=1&setlang=en-US&safesearch=moderate)



This process is going to suck in these states unless you know a good dealer. Good news is that you don‚Äôt have to use the same dealer you bought your car from.

This process sucks because you are at the mercy of the dealer and AFAIK they can charge you whatever they want within reason. I have seen insane fees of $4000-$5000 in Florida.

**Other states** - Get your Lease Buyout quote online. Send the quote to your bank or credit union. A lot of credit unions will treat this as a new car since it‚Äôs a 2023 car. YMMV however.

[Mail your payoff check to:](https://www.kiafinance.com/frequently-asked-questions?section=Payoffs%20and%20Titles)

Kia Finance America

PO Box 660891

Dallas, TX 75266-0891

Or overnight:

Kia Finance America

Box 660891

1501 North Plano Road Suite 100

Richardson, TX 75081

-	For some states the check has to be made out to HCA. Your buyout quote will have instructions on who to make the payment out to.

**Can I buyout immediately?**

Yes, you can buy out as soon as the deal is funded. Typically a week or two or as soon as you can make a Kia Financial account online.

When you do an early lease buyout, you're ending the lease and buying the car outright. Unearned rent charges(interest) are part of the lease financing and no longer apply since you're settling the lease and taking full ownership. Basically, you're paying off the remaining balance, so no more rent charges.


**LEASE BUYOUT IS NOT AN EARLY TERMINATION, THERE IS NO PENALTY FOR BUYING OUT EARLY**


**DO NOT BELIEVE ANY DEALER THAT TELLS YOU CAN ONLY BUYOUT AFTER XX MONTHS.**


**DO NOT BELIEVE ANY DEALER THAT TELLS YOU HAVE TO PAY REMAINING RENT CHARGE**

### What about taxes?

**Ok, this is complicated.**

-	For most states, you pay tax on the monthly payment.

-	Tax is levied upfront on the total lease payment for NY, MN, OH, GA. This leads to an issue of double taxation for early buyouts, at least in NY. No way around it, if you are in NY you should know what you are in for.

-	NJ has no taxes for EV but Kia/Hyundai system charges tax on the buyout. [People have explained how to fix this here with Hyundai and it should be the same procedure](https://www.reddit.com/r/Ioniq5/comments/12jx7l2/hyundai_motor_finance_lease_buyout_without_nj/)

    * For NJ buyouts, request to speak to the Escalation team. Explain to them you would like a buyout quote without sales tax and the NJ ST-4 needs to be routed to the tax team. They asked me write the dealer info as the seller. I was able to payoff my lease by using the website, but there is a 25k restriction per transaction. From /u/ay5800  

-	Tax is levied upfront on the selling price VA, MD, TX. Double taxation is an issue for TX. VA will give you credit for the taxes paid on the lease once you submit proof and then refund you after a few weeks/months. ~~Unsure of MD.~~ MD [seems to have a similar provision as VA to avoid the double tax.](https://reddit.com/r/Ioniq6/comments/12nb4e9/_/jgh0wgg/?context=1)



**Ultimately, I can‚Äôt account for each and every situation. Contact Kia Financial and your local DMV to get a definitive answer.**

- For any California residents: KMF will collect sales tax on your lease buyout, but the Bill of Sale they send to you will not include sufficient documentation for the DMV. You apparently have to call KMF and ask them to send you a Statement of Facts (REG 256) before DMV will transfer the title to you. From /u/ixdy comment [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/KiaEV6/comments/137ib78/leasing_101_or_how_to_get_a_good_deal_on_a_kia_ev6/jusq4q6/?context=3)


### Titling and Registration 

-	Unfortunately Kia Finance has a reputation for being incredibly slow when processing titles for lease buyouts

-	Expect anywhere from 60-90 days to get your title in hand. So if you are planning to flip the car or something, think again.



### Why are you doing this?

I love a good deal and I have been leasing cars for a long time. I use Reddit a lot and I have seen too many people posting misinformation with 100% confidence.

**Please please ask more questions here and I will try my best to answer. I will also add the answers to the post. You cannot have too much information here, feel free to PM me with questions as well.**

In the process, I bid farewell to my 2019 Tesla Model 3 SR+. I'm sad to see it go but am excited for what lies ahead with my new wheels.

I've been in the world of electrified vehicles for about a decade now, starting with a regular hybrid, then a plug-in hybrid, before moving on to full BEVs with the Model 3 and now the EV6.

I'm absolutely in love with the dual motor performance and the expanded cargo volume is most welcome, as is the superior range. But a few of my friends have questioned why I didn't just change to a better-equipped Tesla such as the Model Y Long Range since that would also yield similar benefits. Thus I decided to make this write-up for anyone interested.

**What Kia does better than Tesla**:

* Physical climate controls. I'm not one of those old-men-yelling-at-clouds who hates screens - I actually *liked* how Tesla integrated the lock button, memory profiles, garage door opener, mirror adjustment settings, and headlamp settings into the screen, as their functionality is not compromised and they aren't things you'd need to touch while driving. But climate controls are another story - especially when the interface keeps getting updated in sometimes detrimental ways via OTA. The V11 update in Dec 2021 is a great example of Tesla f'ing up climate controls. I can't express enough how relieved I am to finally have temperature adjustment dials and physical buttons for my heated seats.
* Wiper controls - Not only do the automatic wipers actually work (thanks to using real rain sensors and not computer vision) - I can control them with a stalk without taking my eyes off the road. I absolutely despise Tesla wipers and continue to do so.
* Android Auto - Had a car with AA before I got the Model 3, and I missed it every day until now. While Tesla's nav system is definitely superior to others (likely including Kia's), it just isn't quite the same as Google Maps. Also, Tesla's LTE modem has an annoying habit of taking 5+ minutes to reconnect when driving out of an underground garage, making the nav half-useless until it finally reconnects. My phone, on the other hand, reconnects in milliseconds.
* Driver Assist - the HDA2 suite is essentially equivalent to Enhanced Autopilot on Tesla, while actually working properly thanks to the use of bespoke sensors rather than exclusively relying on computer vision.
* 360 camera. 'Nuff said.
* Ultrasonic sensors. Although my Model 3 had them and they worked very well, since late 2022 the Model 3 and Y have ditched them to save money and relied on a ""Tesla Vision"" replacement that's proven to be hilariously bad by numerous YouTube videos.
* Physical turn signal stalk. Again, this wasn't a problem for my Model 3 but has become a problem with the Highland refresh that will likely apply to the Model Y as well.
* A proper instrument cluster is most welcome. I didn't mind the speedometer being in the centre screen on my Tesla, but the lane-change camera was not very useful in that position. Different story when the lane change camera shows up in your line of sight.
* Build quality that makes me feel like I'm in a real luxury car. The Model 3 can't even compare to a base model Toyota Corolla on fit-and-finish.
* Ride comfort is way better - again, it feels like this car could easily wear a luxury badge and justify it.
* Interior door handles are much more intuitive. It does get tiring to explain to passengers how to open the doors from the inside.

**What Tesla does better than Kia**:

* The phone-as-a-key. It was great to not carry a fat key fob in my pocket. If the phone ever bugged out, my backup key was literally the size of a credit card!
* Tesla's mobile app is unparalleled in functionality and reliability. I could control pretty much everything short of actually driving the car. Disconnections were extremely rare (not counting no-signal situations like parking underground). It seems like pretty much every automaker other than Rivian is way behind on this front.
* Not having an on/off button makes perfect sense in a BEV. You get in, the car turns on. You park and get out, the car shuts off. There's no need for a start/stop button like in ICE cars.
* I was a huge fan of the frunk, especially in my 2019 which had these fold-out hooks to hang grocery/takeout bags. I can't even put my backpack inside the little compartment under the hood in my EV6.
* Walk-away lock was nice to have, but this is a super minor annoyance compared to what I listed above.
* It was great when the charge port closed itself as soon as I unplugged. Again, super minor.
* Sentry Mode really gave peace of mind. I am slowly rectifying this - as soon as I got home, I installed an old dash cam from before I owned the Model 3. I will need to figure out a good way to install a rear-facing dash cam as well.
* PIN to Drive was also a good peace of mind. I live in a pretty safe city and park in a secured garage, but it's always nice to have that extra layer of security if your keys ever get stolen. I don't understand why the rest of the auto industry doesn't copy this, whether EV or ICE.
* No-dealer online purchasing process. Price you see is the price you pay. I fortunately got the EV6 used with no markup but I still would rather not go through dealerships.

**Neutral**:

* While my friends often comment positively about Tesla's all-glass roof, I personally saw zero benefit as I do not look upwards when driving. My EV6 has a solid metal roof with no glass whatsoever and I am perfectly content with that.
* The gimmicks on the Tesla infotainment (video streaming, games, fart sounds, light shows, etc) added zero value for me. I do not miss them.
* I don't have a pet so I never used Dog Mode.
* Supercharging is an obvious advantage for Tesla, but I haven't used it for over a year now that I have L2 charging at home. Plus it's gradually opening up to non-Teslas.
* NACS port is obviously way better but waiting for official NACS adoption in 2025 is not to my advantage, as that means another year of my Tesla depreciating in value and Kia could raise prices in the meantime like they've already done. Dealing with adapters occasionally is well worth saving thousands of dollars.",,,KiaEV6,"Goodbye Model 3, hello EV6",0.97,https://www.reddit.com/r/KiaEV6/comments/190oxod/goodbye_model_3_hello_ev6/

Previously owned a 2017 Chevy Bolt and will never own an ICE ever again, even my outdoor tools are all electric. Took delivery on March 10th and have done all sorts of driving with it. From everyday around town ECO, to hard Sport mode, an 800 mile road trip to Philadelphia, regular trips up into NH and down to Cape Cod. It's been pretty cold the past 7 weeks, so I've averaged around 2.7 mi/kWh, I expect those numbers to climb as it gets warmer. 

This post isn't about the usual love for the car, to keep it short, for those who have not pulled the trigger on one, it is an amazing car, and you will not be disappointed. I have never driven in a Tesla, but it looks way meaner than a Model Y/3 and doesn't have build quality issues, and that was enough for me. My favorite moments are pulling up first to a red light and just launching the thing a mile down the road before the soccer mom next to me even gets rolling. Special shout out to all the slow left lane pick up trucks I roast on the highway too, keep rolling coal buddy, I'll stick to paying $5 to charge up my car at home. 

I've been keeping a list of things about the car that annoy me so far, be interested to hear everyone's thoughts. This won't be the usual reviewer crying about the volume knob (which takes 10 minutes to get used to), these are little things that could be fixed to make the car perfect. I'd actually love to hear other suggestions from this subreddit - I'm sure we could come up with a solid list - I might make it into a youtube video.

I'll start with things I've heard rumors about fixes incoming in the near future but weren't in the spring software update:

1. **Car color in the 3D camera display** \- it's white, my car is black, fix that up. Heard this a fair amount on here.
2. **Wireless Carplay** \- apparently the hardware is there for it, they're just going to turn it on in an update? I wouldn't mind that, but I did buy the Carlinkit Adaptor and that thing has worked flawlessly but having it built in natively would be cooler and cleaner.
3. **DC Fast Charging pre-conditioning** \- I've heard that they were supposed to add this feature so when you pull up to a 350kW charger the car could actually get you the advertised 18 minutes 10-80% charge rate. I've used a handful of Electrify America 350kW chargers so far in all sorts of conditions and it'll start at 75 then creep to 125-150 and if I'm lucky I'll see a 175. I don't think I've seen over 200 which I've heard it's more than capable of 250kW. I can give the car 10-20 minute warning that I'm about to dump a serious amount of charge into the car on a roadtrip, something that I believe Teslas are capable of. I've done an exact 10%-80% fast charge a few times and it took \~27 minutes because it was lolligagging around at 75kW preheating itself for about 7 minutes first. Give me that advertised speed!
4. **Apple CarKey** \- I've heard that the hardware is there for it, would absolutely LOVE this feature. Especially if it means I can just get in the car and drive like Tesla that'd be amazing.
5. **Kia App Support in Massachusetts** \- for those that don't know, because of a right to repair law, Kia has hard coded disabled the Kia Connect app from doing anything with the car based on my VIN where I purchased the car. *This is my single greatest gripe with the car*. For a $65k car in 2022 to not have a remote start/lock/unlock/charge app with the car is disgusting. Figure it out with the state or have a workaround in place. Let's say I lock my keys in the trunk, or want to preheat my car on a cold day from out of key range, with phone in hand, you're saying I'm SOL? In 2022? Madness. I want to confirm with someone at Kia that if I sold the car to someone in another state that this restriction would be removed. If this is the case I will sell the car to my friend in NH for $1 literally to get the app to work. If ANYONE knows a workaround or backdoor for this please let me know.
6. **Sentry Dashcam mode -** The hardware is there for it, and I even heard the Korean version of the car has a USB port to plug a hard drive into for this. I want this so bad! It should be a standard feature in all cars. I hate that I'm going to have to hardwire an ugly aftermarket camera on my windshield when the cameras and technology is right there for it. I don't need side cameras, but to be able to record the front and back views in case of any riff raff would be amazing to have.
7. **Over The Air Updates** \- Heard this one more than anything - I'm sure it's coming - Hook the car to my garage wifi and throw it in while I'm sleeping. Also is there an email list I can be notified when updates come out? Even if I have to bring it to a dealer I love me some new features, also when they implement all my changes below. :)

Here are some changes they could easily make in programming in a future update but I haven't heard too much about around this subreddit:

1. **Different Sound Profiles per drive mode** \- I'd love it if when in Sport mode I could have a different sound profile from when I'm in Eco mode. When I have passengers, I'm usually in Eco mode, a low Cyber mode would be preferred, and when I'm alone and a let's go brandon Dodge Ram pulls up next to me and I put it in Sport mode, a loud Dynamic sound profile would be sick when I absolutely roast him without even trying.
2. **Exit Number Displayed in HUD -** Above the distance to turn amount lower right hand corner on the heads up display, if they could put the exit number that would be amazing. That way I don't even have to glance at the GPS map screen to know which exact exit number/letter to take. Would make highway driving so much easier.
3. **Turn Rear Camera on when in Drive -** A few times I've had stuff piled up in the trunk so I couldn't use the rearview mirror, but I can't turn on the camera system when not a low speed. I'd love to be able to put that view on the screen for safety and awareness' sake.
4. **Chime when Autosteer disengages** \- This is a pretty important safety thing I've noticed on the highway a fair amount of times. When in HDA2 autopilot mode, sometimes you'll get to a part of the highway where the lines are damaged or faded enough where the autosteer disengages and goes from green to white. If just a little chime could alert me of this happening that'd be awesome. A few times I was cruising along and all the sudden I'm drifting more than is normal and I'll notice the car just unceremoniously stopped steering itself and the icon changing colors isn't noticeable enough an alert on its own. Doesn't have to be like the big lane keep alert sound, but just a quick small chime to tell me it's disengaged would be sweet.
5. **Autopilot prefers wrong side of the lane -** I love autopilot on the highway, it works well enough where I trust it a lot at this point and can't imagine a car without it. I do a lot of driving in the left lane and would love it if it hugged the yellow line a bit more, sometimes, especially on left corners, it will drift to the right side of the lane a bittt too close to other cars in the next lane. Obviously it never hits them, but I would feel better if it just hugged the inside line a bit better, even on straight aways too.
6. **Automatic Lane Change too hard to use** \- I've tried to use this a fair amount of times and it's just too clunky. You need to be holding the steering wheel, but somehow not put any input into the wheel or it will cancel the change? If I'm in HDA2 and it knows it's clear - just go for it, don't check the wheel and have it cancel itself by me telling it I'm holding the wheel. Sometimes I have the right touch, but it's annoying.
7. **Seat Memory not available while not in Park -** Lots of time I'll be already rolling down the driveway when I notice my seat's not perfect but it won't let me hit seat memory while in drive. I can understand if you're going highway speeds but stopped at a red light or rolling down the driveway I can't just hit the button? 
8. **NAV Keyboard not available while not in Park -** Kind of the same as previous, I can understand if you're going 20mph+, but if I'm at a red light I need to put the car fully in park to plug something into the GPS? Come on. 
9. **Both ETA and Trip Duration on Map screen** \- I know there's an option to toggle whether it shows the ETA or the time until arrival, but I wish I had both shown at the same time? Maybe just on longer drives, or maybe even show the duration until you need to take an exit on a long drive? ""In 35 minutes take exit 12"" or something, it's a little niche request but sometimes time math is hard to do.
10. **Clearer way to discern if the car is remotely started** \- Since I don't have the app to precondition, I have to go to my front window and hit the key button to start it. I find it difficult to know if I actually hit the button combo-hold correctly. Do flashing lights mean it's on? Should the parking lights stay on like the Chevy Bolt? Hell even have the lady charging voice say that the car is started, I'd be able to hear it. While you're at it, maybe a default temperature setting in the menu so I know when I hit that button what temperature and settings it will start working towards.
11. **Assign key to driving profile** \- Can I assign a specific key to a driving profile? One key for my profile, and the other for my wife? I get in and the car knows it's me because it's my key... That'd be cool.
12. **Lock when walk away** \- I've seen this parroted here, but lock the car when I walk away with the key, pretty standard stuff.
13. **Unlock when trunk opening** \- Maybe this is a safety thing, and if it is, fine, but  when I open the trunk with the trunk button or the auto-opening, I need the option to just unlock the rest of the doors. I'm holding something heavy and I use the ""stand there"" method to auto-open it, my wife is just waiting for the car to unlock because my key is buried in my pocket with my hands full. Also the day I lock the key in the trunk because the doors didn't unlock, I'm gonna be pissed.
14. **Preserve GPS Saved Locations** \- All of my saved locations in the GPS got wiped when I updated the NAV software - can there be a way to preserve those on update or offload them - I had a great saved list going until it all go wiped this week when i updated the software - super lame. Not sure I want to spend the time putting them all back in if every 6 months update will set me back to 0. 
15. **Trailer hitch shouldn't need you to cut a hole in the faring -** Kia should make a faring with the hole already in it for a cleaner look. I'm not going with the OEM hitch, waiting for the stealth hitch in a few months, but the Kia hitch shouldn't require a tech with a mitre saw to notch a hole in the underside of the car for the hitch, has to be a better way.
16. **Black emblem badges** \- I want blacked out emblem badges, let's hurry up production on those.

These two I think are 2023 model suggestions, not much I can do with my 2022:

1. **LEDs look pink not red** \- kind of takes the edge off of Sport mode. If they can fix this in software that'd be great, but it seems like they just used the wrong kind of LEDs with no good red value.
2. **Sueded seats holes debris** \- Build quality of the seats is good - but the perforations take too much attention with the vacuum to get right - I'd have to vacuum daily to keep them looking good - they just eat dirt and debris to easily and look clogged.
3. **Interior trim too glossy** \- fingerprints and dust show up instantly, and the sun's reflection of the center pieces is blinding, going to have to wrap mine to get something with a matte finish.

**Random EV thoughts:**

1. **Chargepoint only allows one home charger per account** \- I have two Chargepoint EV chargers running at 48A at my house and my cape house (bougie) and had to make a separate account for each charger? super lame. They make great chargers and the EV6 taking a huge 11kW at a time is sick.
2. **Quirk Kia in Braintree, MA is run by clowns**. Buying cars from dealerships to begin with is a joke. I will do everything in my power to quicken their demise. I could do a whole another post about their incompetence from sales to service to even their parts department. 
3. **Can't wait to have solar panels** \- Powering this beast with the sun even though my power company gives me a nighttime 9 cents/kWh rate would be the ultimate. I have a south facing hill - ground mount 16-24kw array here I come.
4. **Plans:**
   1. New Rims - the stock ones just look a bit too dopey, will keep them for winter tires though.
   2. Paint calipers - I'm thinking a deep red would go best with black?
   3. Summer tires - I bet I can get even more acceleration with the Pirelli PZ4 tires I bought.
   4. Ceramic coat - Pricey but the black car butt picks up too much dirt and the air current doesn't get it clean when it rains.
   5. Window tint - I think I did 10% everywhere but the windshield - sprang for the kind that really cuts the sun's power so the car will have to work less hard to keep it cool in the summer.
   6. Integrated Radar detector - Pricey too, but with all the nighttime highway driving I do, I want to be able to cruise without worry.
   7. Wrap shiny interior black trim - it's just too glossy - fingerprints, dust, sunlight reflections, i need something with a matte finish so it looks clean longer.
   8. Plastiip emblems - if Kia won't make em - I'll have to do it. I'm leaving the front logo and taking off the rear logo - keeping the EV6 and the GTLine badge though.
   9. Hardwired Dashcam - sad I even have to do this with 5 other cameras on the car in 2022.

**Accessories I've bought and recommend:**

Some background: The roads in NZ are maintained by using a portion of money from the ""National Land Transport Fund"". This Fund (NLTP) gets its money from a few different sources, including:  	

1. Fuel Excise Duty 	        (FET) 	
2. Road User Charges	(RUC) 	
3. Vehicle & Driver Registration & Licensing 	
4. Road Tolling   

FET is paid by people who drive petrol cars, it is a charge they add on to the petrol price: it costs 70.024c per litre. (As a side note, the government taxes you on this FET so it actually costs 80.5276c, but this extra does not go to the NLTP so I will not count it).  

RUC is paid by Diesel Vehicles (since they don't pay FET) and now also EVs.   

The cost of a RUC is based on distance travelled, so you will have to buy a 1000km pre-pay card/license to display on your windshield for $76. You can buy multiple of 1000km, so if you want you can get 10,000km in one go. There will be an additional charge of $12.44 per transaction.  

So, if you buy a RUC License for 10,000km, you will pay $772.44 (76\*10 + 12.44). With this RUC License, if you commute 50 km per day, this will cost you $3.86 in RUC fees.    

Let's compare this to a 2010 Toyota Corolla with a fuel efficiency of 7.4L/100km. This vehicle can cover 50km by using 3.7L of petrol, so by comparison the FET this vehicle will pay to travel the same distance will be only $2.59. The EV is paying \~1.5x more to the NLTP for driving the same distance.   

Now imagine you have a more modern petrol car, with even greater efficiency, you will pay even less to the NLTP.  Another way to look at it (if we stick to the 10,000km RUC License example) would be to think of the EV as an ICE Vehicle with an efficiency of 11.03L/100km. Because that is the efficiency of the engine you'd need to be paying the same $3.86 in FET fees.  

The average age of the NZ light vehicle fleet is roughly 15 years. This means the 2010 Toyota Corolla represents the average fuel consumption of NZ vehicles,    
Why then is the RUC for EVs set to equivalent to vehicles which consume 11L/100km? It makes no sense.   

&#x200B;

TLDR:  EV Road User Charges are overpriced, even when you buy in  bulk it's the equivalent of a petrol car with the fuel efficiency of a tank (11L/100km).    
They should be priced lower to match the NZ average fuel consumption. ",,,nzev,EV RUC Costs Compared to ICE Vehicle Fuel Excise Tax: Unfair.,0.82,https://www.reddit.com/r/nzev/comments/19f38yp/ev_ruc_costs_compared_to_ice_vehicle_fuel_excise/

Another guy ( tesla model X)  was trying make the most of the situation by parking in the passage and charging. So i asked the lady when she arrived if she should have waited until her charging finished and move the car to other parking spot. She didn‚Äôt seem to believe that was right thing to do.

Just to clarify it was a BP charger, the car was at 82% when unplugged, we were keeping an eye on the app hence us going back out to see what was going on and no we didn‚Äôt see or confront the other driver as we had no idea if this was kosher or not.

A tourist here who's been traveling around the South Island in an EV for the last week. I've driven over 1000 km including Aoraki National Park, Queenstown, Dunedin, and Christchurch. First off, wanted to say thank you to a few folks who pointed out some key tips for me as I planned my EV trip, especially getting a ChargeNet RFID FOB in advance.

So, this may run contrary to many opinions here, but in my experience, NZ has the best EV charging network. I essentially lost any sense of range anxiety after a day or two. It felt like every 30-50 km, there was a ChargeNet L3 station that I could generally depend on. I rarely saw a station down in the entire island on the ChargeNet app. There were two spots where I had to wait a few minutes for someone else's car to finish, but everyone was very diligent about moving their vehicles once finished.

In the future, the main limitation I can see are queues for the stations as more people transition to EVs. So increasing the number of stations in a location will probably be key. But in my admittedly limited experience, NZ has made it by far the easiest and more comfortable for EV travel. I've driven EVs extensively in a couple of other countries of differing degrees of modernization (U.S. and Sri Lanka), and I've unsuccessfully tried to plan EV trips in some (Australia and Japan). NZ takes the cake above all of those!

‚óè Quieter
‚óè More comfortable, suspension is great. The way it handles speed bumps is a massive improvement.  Doesn't jolt you. 
‚óè Handling is even better, steering is sharper, sport handling seems lighter. 
‚óè Blind spot light is bright enough but looks a little rubbish IMO. Would have been cool as a T
‚óè Cooled seat were nice, wish it would be stronger on the back rather than bottom. My back needed more cooling than my nuts. 
‚óè Because the cabin is quieter it seems like the air conditioning system is louder now or more noticeable even on low.
‚óè Door thud is solid and sounds more European. 
‚óè Using the screen to put it into drive and reverse was great and didn't have me missing the gear selector. The indicators are a bit weird.

I really like the rear, looks great and the fact it has two power struts is better.
Not the biggest fan of the front. Maybe it'll grow on me.

I went from a 2018 $21k ICE Golf to a 2018 $19.5k Leaf 40G leaf. 77km on golf, 49km / 89% on leaf. 

Driving / practicality  
The ICE car handled better and has a nicer cabin but the instant torque of the leaf and effortless driving around town means that for 90% of our driving, I prefer the Leaf. Features wise, they were line ball ‚Äì the Golf had a better screen and digital dash and more premium feel, the Leaf has 360 camera but a shit screen. Both have adaptive cruise, blind spot monitor, small army of airbags etc. Leaf has a much bigger boot which is a huge plus. Range and battery degradation the biggest downside for the Leaf but given its our second car, that doesn‚Äôt matter for us.   


Economics 

Golf running costs: 7% cost of capital (interest on mortgage as proxy) on $21k = $1.5k; Depreciation = $3k; Insurance $1k; petrol for 13,000 km $3k and service / rego $700. Total annual cost = $9.1k  

Leaf: Cost of capital: 0 as I got a 5 year interest free loan. Depreciation $3k, Insurance $1.2k, service and rego $300 (generous ‚Äì I doubt it needs annual servicing). Electricity for 13,000 km $400 but I have 3 hours free each night which makes this pretty much free. Total annual cost: $4.5k.  

For the loan, it‚Äôs with Westpac. I had given them robust feedback that every bank apart from them offered an EV loan! Terms are 5 years, interest free, up to $50k, invoice from dealer required. 

So, by making the swap we save nearly $5k per annum.  For me an absolute no brainer. RUCS will trim potentially up to $1k of that.",,,nzev,Recent switch to EV. My numbers,0.92,https://www.reddit.com/r/nzev/comments/1556r5h/recent_switch_to_ev_my_numbers/

I have had a horrible experience with Tesla and their team in the past couple of days. My family purchased our new car a couple months ago and was enjoying it up until a few days ago when I tried to get the car into gear and it demanded that I input the password. Having not set up a password previously, I contacted Tesla about the issue. 

While I was waiting to speak with a representative, I noticed that my car was no longer linked to my account on the app, nor could I log into my Tesla account. After waiting on hold for two hours, I was finally able to get through to a representative who informed me that I needed to contact Tesla Financial about this issue. I called the number provided immediately but they did not pick up as they were outside of working hours.

‚ÄúNot a problem.‚Äù I thought. I‚Äôd call back again tomorrow and sort this out. I left my car in the parking lot at work overnight and had a family member pick me up and drop me off the next morning. While I‚Äôm working the next day, my boss informs me that there is a tow truck outside to tow my car. Confused, I went out to the parking lot and was told by the towing company that Tesla is repossessing my vehicle. 

This is where my confusion grew. We had paid for the vehicle IN FULL at the time we picked it up from the dealership, but the towing company is just doing what tesla told them to do. so they took my car.

Shortly afterward, my father received a phone call from Tesla Financial and he asked them what was going on. They told him that Tesla had been trying to reach out to us multiple times through phone and email about a debt they have been attempting to collect on the car. 

My father had been out of the country for the past couple months so any phone calls would not have reached him. He did not receive a single voicemail about this issue either. He looked through his emails and noticed that he did in fact receive only two emails on July 27 and July 28, stating that we had not yet paid for the car and that the full cost of the vehicle is still at large. These emails went ignored as he believed them to be a phishing attempt because we had already PAID IN FULL at the dealership. He also believed that Tesla could not have made such a huge mistake like this.

My father explained this over the phone but the representative did not budge. This Tesla representative was rude and unprofessional for the entire phone call‚Äîgoing so far as to yell at my father over the phone.

A different Tesla representative sent us an email that seemed to be a copy paste of what they had sent my father back in July and that this car is now being considered for repossession. I shot an email back explaining AGAIN that this car had been paid for in full already and that we have been very dissatisfied by how Tesla had been handling this situation.

Up until this point, we were under the impression that Tesla was repossessing our vehicle without any warning because the two emails they sent to us regarding this seemed to be a phishing scam. Again they left no voicemails about this either. 

The Tesla representative then emailed back this statement:

‚ÄúI am having the team fully post the funds of the cashier's check. I am redrafting the documents and title/lien to your name instead of [BANK]. I have attached documents. Once funds post I can then restore access to the vehicle and release title/lien to your name.‚Äù

Basically saying that they had the check this whole time but due to some internal oversight had not cashed it. And they came after us, accused us of not paying, and repossessed our vehicle. Not only that, they incorrectly had the title of our car under the bank‚Äôs name rather than our own.

The next day, we received another email stating that the car is now back under our name and it can be picked up from the tow yard. 

No apology. No restitution. 

My father emailed them back saying he was glad the issue was resolved but was disappointed that there was no restitution offered, not even an apology. 

They then emailed back the equivalent of saying ‚Äúwell we did try to contact you about this.‚Äù 

I shot back an email stating that we are frustrated because it seems like this was an internal accounting issue that we should not have been contacted about or been involved in, in the first place. 

Now we find ourselves carless for four days and will have to go out of our way to pick up a car that was wrongly repossessed. 

And still Tesla offers no apology, restitution, and no guarantee that they are taking steps to prevent anything like this from happening in the future.

EDIT: the car was paid for with a combination of card and CASHIER‚ÄôS check. Cashiers check means the amount of money is withdrawn from the bank when it‚Äôs ISSUED not cashed. so no, we did not notice extra money sitting in our account because it had already been withdrawn.

UPDATE: we got the car back today and there is no damage to it. we have been talking about getting an attorney or at least taking this to small claims court but in the end the decision comes down to what my dad wants to do as he owns the car. 

will probably not be updating again because i‚Äôm tired of thinking about this but we‚Äôll see. i‚Äôm really upset with tesla and would return the car if i could.",,,RealTesla,Tesla repossessed my car due to an extreme oversight on their end,0.97,https://www.reddit.com/r/RealTesla/comments/15u8wuv/tesla_repossessed_my_car_due_to_an_extreme/

Went in as a (mid 20's) guy and just asked to look and the salesman grabbed they keys and sat me in the driver's seat of a CPO 4S right away with no issues.

He could tell I was kind of holding back (the throw on the throttle is much more than my other cars), and encouraged me to give it my all.


What an absolute beauty of a car and drive, the steering is tight and responsive, let alone the speed.

If anything the test drive convinced me to get a base model... The 4s was heart shatteringly fast.

After we got back (and he had me test launch control) he gave me no pressure at all and just gave me a card and sent me on my way. 

10/10 experience.

Not sure why I made this post other than to say I'm in love with this car, and hopefully my career goals pan out because I definitely can't afford it right now XD

I‚Äôve been following this sub as well as Taycanforums obsessively, thinking a GTS ST would be my next car. The car is beautiful in person but the drive was‚Ä¶ not what I expected. For reference, I drive an Alfa Romeo Stelvio QV and used to drive a Porsche Boxster.

1. The interior, in all black GTS spec, is just claustrophobic and drab. I saw a Turbo with chalk that lightened things up a bit. But in all black it did not feel inviting or worth $140k at all.

2. In my head, my main issue is the disconnect between what I perceive to be a nice, analog Porsche driving experience in terms of steering, feedback and ride, and a very digital power plant. The car is fast, violently fast, but there‚Äôs no ‚Äúthrottle response,‚Äù it‚Äôs just push and go. And don‚Äôt even get me started on the Porsche sound. It‚Äôs way too loud and fake sounding when it‚Äôs on, and when it‚Äôs off there‚Äôs just.. nothing. I wish you could turn the volume down on the sound instead of just on or off.

3. I drove this car on probably the worst road in San Diego. The ride was acceptable, but there was an insane amount of tire noise and rock/water noise pinging in the wheel wells/undercarriage. This is something I‚Äôm accustomed to from the Boxster but figured sound insulation would be better in the Taycan.

The Taycan seems to occupy this middle ground between EVs that are made to be appliances and silent bullet trains, and Porsches that are made to be the opposite. My brain can‚Äôt get around the melding of the two. I‚Äôve driven Teslas and electric BMWs that felt just right- silent barges on the road. But the Taycan just felt confused to me. I will probably try driving this car again on better roads.. when it‚Äôs not wet.

In June 2021, I decided to switch it up and got a 2021 Taycan Turbo S.  Absolutely the most thrilling car I've ever owned.

It's been a truly wonderful experience, and until recently my plan was to let the lease expire at the end of this year and roll into a 2025. I'm just waiting for my dealer to accept 2025 build specs. But now it looks like my Porsche experience is going to end on a sour note. I likely won't buy another Porsche.

The car had been running flawlessly. I took it in for a 40,000 mile check which includes tire inflation, wiper fluid, and other routine maintenance. A tiny dent was spotted on the metal plate which protects the HV battery. I'm not sure what caused the dent. Presumably a pothole. Service department said that even a tiny dent means the battery needs to be removed, inspected, and probably replaced. This, despite the fact that the battery is working perfectly fine.

So I trusted them. The battery replacement cost was $48k including parts and labor. My insurance covered it all, less my $1,000 deductible. Money was sent the the dealer.

And there the car sat. No work done whatsoever. **It's been nearly two months now**. It's not as though there's a dispute over costs, labor, money, etc. And it's not as though there's a shortage of specialists. This is one of the nation's largest Porsche dealers / service departments.

They have the cash payment and agree that the battery will be replaced. But they're unable to get the battery shipped from Germany.

The excuses are always along the lines of, ""We're waiting on so and to sign off and release the battery."" It's just bureaucratic silliness.

I've made two lease payments despite not having use of my car. I'm not planning on making a third.

They gave me some crappy housewife Porsche SUV to drive around as a loaner in the meantime.

So that's where I stand. I hired a really good auto lawyer to negotiate on my behalf. Not sure how much he can do though, since he's a lemon law dude and this isn't really a lemon law case. My first meeting with him is on Tuesday of next week. My hope is that he can:

* get Porsche to agree to a suspension of lease payments until lease winds down, or
* get a loaner Taycan Turbo S for me to drive until my lease is up while I continue making lease payments, or
* get the lease canceled with no penalty, in which case I'll be carless for a while, or
* fix the darned car before my next lease payment is due

I also opened a case with Porsche North America. I can already tell that's a dead end. No one is following up, and I doubt they'll be accommodative regarding skipping the lease payments. I'm told that they simply don't care and will ignore you unless you get an attorney involved. I only went down this path to get an official case number for my attorney.

Needless to say, this will be my last Porsche. I'll follow-up on this thread over time and let you know the outcome, just in case any of you find yourself in a similar position, so you'll at least know what to do (or what not to do!) to get compensation.

For what it's worth, the Taycan TS is the most enjoyable car I've ever driven. It's not a quality issue. It's purely a customer service issue. So weird that my relationship with Porsche is ending this way.

The power grid is not able to handle this type of demand, and allot of neighborhoods are experiencing power outages for hours at a time when the temperature outside is in the single digits. We had the power go out for 6 hours last night. Our house does not have gas, and we ran out of firewood... what are we going to do. If only we had some sort of sleeping pod with a 75kw battery that can keep us warm through the night. Oh wait we do. So my wife my dog and my newborn daughter slept in the garage in our Model3 all nice and cozy. If I didn't have this car, it would have been a very rough night.

Thanks for all the real support guys.

And to the ""helpful"" use a blanket advice... you can't just wrap an infant in a bunch of blankets and go to sleep.",,,teslamotors,My Tesla kept my family from freezing last night.,0.85,https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/ll4ffe/my_tesla_kept_my_family_from_freezing_last_night/
