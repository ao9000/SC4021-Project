People seem to love them for multiple reasons but the main being their pleasing to the eye MPG ratings, and their higher torque numbers over their regular gasoline counterparts.  I am currently in the market for a wagon (yeah, I know) and I am drawn towards the Volkswagen Sportwagen (Golf Sportwagen, Jetta Sportwagen, Golf Variant, or whatever else it may be called).  Once you start looking at VWs you begin to notice all of their TDIs and I must admit, they’re appealing…except for one thing, the diesel premium.  Diesel models are more expensive than their regular gasoline counterparts.  This led me to do some research. 


I wanted to know how many miles you would have to drive in order to cover the premium you pay when buying a diesel.  (Now, I know I’m only covering the MPG issue of diesels and not addressing the added “fun to drive” factor you get with a diesel which, arguably could have a lot of attraction to some buyers.)  


Ok, so I took the 2014 VW Golf as my test vehicle.  I used the base MSRPs, an average U.S. diesel price of $3.90/gallon and an average regular gasoline price of $3.66/gallon.  Giving an advantage to the TDI, I will show the results using the listed highway MPGs:


2014 Golf TDI: MSRP $26,020, MPG: 42, Cost per mile: $0.093


2014 Golf 2.5: MSRP $20,815, MPG: 30, Cost per mile: $0.122


Difference in price: $5,205.


Miles needed to drive the TDI and save $5,205 over the Golf 2.5:  **178,603**


So, my question is, (and I don’t have a good answer) why are TDIs so popular?


*EDIT - Just wanted to say thanks for all the input everyone has given.  Lots of good information in here.  I'm sure I'll be referring back to this once those 2015 Sportwagens make their way to the US.

Coming from a basic understanding here.      
Curious to hear from the masses.     

What I’ve heard is:
- chemically, diesel fuel burns with more energy output than gasoline, making a more efficient combustion.
- due to that chemical property, diesel engines have higher MPG in some cases and more miles per tank.
- diesel fuel is cheaper/easier to make. It costs more than gas at the moment, but hasn’t always and hopefully it will at least even out.
- Diesel engines can be more robust, last more miles, less maintenance
- Diesel engines are more accepted elsewhere, like Europe, but for some reason aren’t in the US?
 
Is it just a culture thing, like diesel is only for semis and tractors and lifted trucks?

I drive a 2019 Audi Q5 equipped with 2.0lt 4-cylinder gasoline engine producing 248hp in Canada, and let me tell you this: Performance is not good compared to that Velar while fuel consumption is much higher.

Now I can understand why diesel is not popular with performance cars because there isn't much range to play with or even with smaller cars considering higher upfront cost and heavier weight of diesel engine but I cannot make sense of not having more diesel SUVs in North America after driving that Velar.

Ideally you won't be wanting to rev an SUV so a powerful diesel engine's ""push you back into your seat as soon as you push the throttle at 1500 rpm while you're driving normally"" seems like the ideal performance people would expect from SUVs while my basically same horsepower Q5 responds like a bored hooker when you floor the throttle at low-normal driving rpms.
