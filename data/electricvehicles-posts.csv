This is a post about a complete lack of customer service. 

I preordered a Model 3 LR three months ago. I was given a delivery window of Mid November to mid December. I got a message last week saying it was my turn to pick up my car. Sweet. They give me a choice of three days on their website to pick up the car. November 24, 25, 26. I find it a bit odd that thanksgiving they are open but I'm working on the 24th and the 26th and on such short notice I can't get out of work. So I put down delivery for the 25th. After all other stores are open on thanksgiving and the site blacked out other dates. 

I get messages from Tesla that I need to get my car insurance and pay the down payment or I won't be able to get the car. No problem. 

I pay the down payment via their app and get the insurance. I upload the proof to their app. All good. 

Then yesterday on 11/22/2021 I get a phone call at 3 pm saying that I can no longer pick up the car on 11/25 because they aren't actually open. 

Uh ok. So you tell me this after I put down the down payment and pay for the insurance. I'm a little pissed at this point but I get it. Let me pick it up another day then. And why didn't you tell me sooner?

They would only let me pick the 24th or 26th. That's it. I asked them can I pick up the car on December 2nd because I have work and can't reschedule or get someone to cover me on such short notice. Their response is ""no, we can't hold the car that long. We will give your car to someone else and you can wait another 3-4 weeks for another car to come in.""

The heck? They made the mistake. Took my money. Made me buy insurance for a car that I don't actually have and then they try to bully me into a specific delivery date on short notice? That's not fair. 

To make matters worse I try to post my story to r/teslamotors and it gets automatically deleted. I appealed it to a mod and he says ""This is not high quality content.""

Excuse me? I've never had such piss poor customer service from any car brand as I have had with this Tesla buying experience. 

I then say: ""Are we not allowed to criticize Tesla here? How much stock do you own?""

The mods response was ""How many days do you want to be banned?""

Edit:
Elon, make it right. https://twitter.com/spicy_masala1/status/1463287759523700751?s=21

Criticism is typically shunned by the Tesla fanboys, even if it is justified and unbiased. 

Second, I went with a Tesla because the technology was way above (IMO) the rest. Very much best in class, even though I feel like the outer design is a little too “different” for my taste. I’ve really enjoyed driving it. But the gap is quickly closing, and some of the design decisions and manufacturing makes me scratch my head.

The “ashamed” part, however, stems from the leader of the organization. He has become so polarizing that I can’t even have a conversation with people I meet regarding my Tesla without his name coming up. It makes me feel like people are looking at me as if I share his views because I own one. I wish he would just fade into obscurity with his billions and call it a win. I cannot wait for something to pop up (maybe the Rivian R1S) that grabs my interest the way Tesla initially did.

I have heard that petrol cars can not refuel at home while you sleep? How often do you have to refill elsewhere? Is this several times a year? Will there be a solution for refueling at home?

2. Which parts will I need service on and how often? The car salesman mentioned a box with gears in it. What is this and will I receive a warning with an indicator when I need to change gear? 

3. Can I accelerate and brake with one pedal as I do today with my electric car?

4. Do I get fuel back when I slow down or drive downhill? I assume so, but need to ask to be sure. 

5. The car I test drove seemed to have a delay from the time I pressed the accelerator pedal until it began to accelerate. Is that normal in petrol cars?

6. We currently pay about 1.2p per mile to drive our electric car. I have heard that petrol can cost up to 10 times as much so I reckon we will lose some money in the beginning. We drive about 20,000 miles a year. Let's hope more people will start using petrol so prices go down.

7. Is it true that petrol is flammable? Should I empty the tank and store the petrol somewhere else while the car is in the garage? 

8. Is there an automatic system to prevent gasoline from catching fire or exploding in an accident. What does this cost?

9. I understand that the main ingredient in petrol is oil. Is it true that the extraction and refining of oil causes environmental problems as well as conflicts and major wars that over the last 100 years have cost millions of lives? Is there a solution to these problems?

10..I have heard that cars with internal combustion based engines are being banned to enter more and more cities around the world, as it is claimed that they tend to harm the environment and health of their citizens?? Is that true??

I drive a 2023 EV6 and have been an EV enthusiast for years so I know that if I want the most efficient charging experience I should use the 350kw units. As I pulled in I see a beautiful 2023 BMW iX on the 150 unit with the chademo plug with the hypercharger stalls open. I pulled into my 350 and (surprise) charged on 1st attempt at full max speeds. 

The woman in the iX was on the phone and appeared very frustrated. She then got in her car and moved to the 350 next to me. She then tried multiple times to get it to work, using her app, her credit card, and eventually broke down in tears because she couldn't figure it out. Her husband has been on the phone and was yelling at her because she couldn't figure it out. I stepped over and offered to help her out. She was flustered but agreed to let me try to help her. I had her unplug and reset her EA app. Within 5 minutes I had her charging. She was essentially doing things in the wrong order and the station was timing out every time. She had been trying to charge for over 30 minutes, had trued all the stalls and couldn't figure it out.

I bring this all up to remind the folks in this sub that we need to be the facilitators of change and help anyone we see having issues getting their cars to charge. Many of the new EV owners don't really know what they're doing, and having a negative experience on their 1st charging session not at home can impact their longterm views on EVs.
