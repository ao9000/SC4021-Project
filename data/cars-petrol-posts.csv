I am about to embark on a restoration quest this autumn. Object in question is my first ever car a 2004 MG ZR 160. Problem: I am an absolute noob but will try to learn it along the way so it will likely take some time lol.   


First question though, the car stood in a garage for some time (2-3 years) and sadly said garage will be sold so I will have to change location. How bad an idea would it be to change location while driving the car, considering that the fluids have been in there for 2-3 years.

A while back I learned that this is actually only true for turbo diesels. NA diesels make shit torque per liter.

Now, I am finding out that not even turbo diesels seem to produce (at least significantly) more torque than turbo petrol engines.

I tried looking at some common (I believe) turbo diesel and petrol engines. A quick google gave me a few engines from Toyota, Honda and Skoda.

And of these engines, the one with highest torque/liter is in fact a 1 liter turbo petrol from Skoda producing 200 Nm. In second place was a 2 liter turbodiesel from Skoda producing 380 Nm (so only 190 Nm/liter). Sadly Skoda didn't provide max boost pressures, so I looked at Honda for that.

I looked at three Honda diesels and three Honda petrols. Torque per liter was 137-173/liter for the petrols and 133-187/liter for the diesels. I also calculated an ""effective displacement""=displacement\*(1+boost), where boost is given in bar. Using this I found torque/""edisp"" for petrols to be 72-85 Nm/liter and for diesels 70-97 Nm/liter.

So these numbers tell me that diesels actually don't seem to be making significantly more torque than similar petrol engines when turbocharging is taken into account. I challenge anyone to find a stock engine with more than 200 Nm/liter (well, I've not looked far so I expect people to succeed).

Do people have more data readily available to either confirm or deny this? Do diesels actually produce more torque per liter or is this just because people actually often compare turbodiesels with NA petrols?

Edit: Just had a look at Volvo engines as well. Take the V90 for example, it comes with either 2l diesels or petrols, all turbocharged. The petrols produce 350-400 Nm/l and the diesels 320-480 Nm/l. So both higher and lower (and the Volvo [D4204T23](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volvo_Engine_Architecture#D4204T23) turbodiesel currently takes the lead as the stock engine with highest torque/liter with 240 Nm/l).

Edit2: Other honorable mentions are the Land Cruiser with 212 Nm/liter, Mercede's  119CDI  with 220 Nm/liter and GM's  LZ0 Duramax with 224 Nm/liter. Scania's DC13 174 produces at most 209 Nm/liter from a 12.7 liter diesel.

Edit3 (and probably last edit): If anyone still stumbles across this post, Mercedes C300d makes 550Nm from a 2.0L so 275 Nm/L (a turbodiesel). However, I found the Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution X with the UK specific special edition FQ-440 MR (only 40 sold) with 559 Nm from a 2.0L turbopetrol, so that makes 279.5 Nm/L and the current record holder of stock car engines that have been produced in higher quantities than 25 by the original manufacturer.

The freevalve Tiny Friendly Giant engine by Koeningsegg produces 600 Nm from 2 liters (turbopetrol), but I'm pretty sure 25 Gemeras have not been made (and definitely not sold, since the Gemera is not for sale yet).

However, if we move away from car engines to ship engines, e.g. the Wärtsilä RT-flex96C 14-cylinder 2-stroke turbodiesel (well, actually heavy fuel oil, but runs as a 2-stroke diesel) has 297 Nm/L. This engine is found in e.g. the Maersk E-class container ships. I expect more modern ship engines to have even more torque/liter, but finding info on them is tedious.",None,None,Do diesels actually have more torque than petrol engines?

For any mods, I hope its an appropriate post for this sub. I don't know if anyone cares, but today made me really thankful for the existence of vehicles that are rugged and capable but still cheap as hell.

It's so easy in the Western world to get caught up in the Horsepower Wars, sub-3s 0-60 times, and changing design languages. But today made me realize how much of a blessing these cheap workhorses are to us.

I'm American temporarily working in an African country. My job brings me out to remote villages along abysmal asphalt roads full of potholes or dirt roads riddled with muddy ruts. Roads are 2 lane and you have to constantly use the incoming lane to overtake giant trucks completely laden with cargo that's way over safety guidelines (and usually not tied down).

Driving is not a glamorous thing here, so until now so I have been renting a shit sedan from a manufacturer I don't even recognize. It feels like its made of more plastic than metal, beats you up over every bump, and has abysmal acceleration (probably like 12s 0-60). It can barely overtake the aforementioned giant trucks. But it costs 10$/day to rent, and my funding is too low to go much higher so I've made do.

Today I had to drive into the bush for a few days and I got this gut feeling that maybe I should rent a better car. However everything was out of my price range: Subaru for 100$/day, Mitsubishi for 80$, etc. That is until I found a '06 RAV4 for fucking 30$/day. It was dented, scraped to hell, and full of cig burns, but it had a V6 with 269 HP and 6.4s 0-60.

I took the RAV4 and as soon as I hit the road, I felt worlds better than that shitty sedan. A couple hours later I found myself driving up a steep incline, stuck behind a giant tanker going 10mph as it struggled up the hill. A horribly-maintained looking truck from the 80's with crudely-hand painted letters on the back reading ""DANGER PETROL"".

I opt to overtake the tanker. Halfway through the overtake a gigantic truck laden with steel bars careens over the hill and directly at me. I can't merge back into my lane because of the Petrol truck, and it was going too slow to smash the brake and get back behind the tanker. My only option was to step on the gas and try to gap the petrol truck to rejoin my lane before the incoming steel truck flattened me.

Thanks to Toyota's dirt-cheap 269hp, I gapped the tanker and got back into my lane with the incoming truck inches in front of me. It clipped my mirror but it didn't break off somehow.

If I was in that crappy sedan I would have died there. But that grimy RAV4 saved me. I'm alive today because there's a car that lasts so many years that it's rentable for pocket change, while *also* truly performing when you give it the beans.

So thanks Toyota for making cars like this. I owe you one :)

&#x200B;

**EDIT:** I know that unsafe passes are a completely irresponsible thing to do for all parties. I would never willingly undertake one. In the Bush you can almost never see enough of the road in front to determine if there is oncoming traffic.

There is dirt, jungle, and debris lining the roads that you couldn't imagine until you've seen it. All professional drivers I've talked to here refer to overtaking skill as an ""instinct"". People die here doing it. A lot. I'm trying to develop this instinct now.

This in turn tells us that nuclear waste is generated from both phosphate and rare earth element mining. And now cars too? Radio active waste is forever. I hope there are pure forms of phosphate and no immitation knockoffs, isotopes would work into the food chain and out our exaust pipes! Luckily chinese knock offs were never an issue.

A trademark application discovered by CarBuzz suggests BMW is preparing to name its first electric M car the 'iM3' – amid reports the next-generation M3 will expand to pure battery power when it arrives in 2027.

In September 2023, BMW development boss Frank Weber announced the electric M3 would have four electric motors producing up to 1000kW, telling UK publication Autocar ""the next M3 will be battery-electric – full battery-electric"".

 In October, BMW M CEO Frank van Meel confirmed the four electric motors would be controlled by a central computer, nicknamed the ""Hand of God"" – also previously referred to as a ""Heart of Joy"".

However, there will reportedly be some overlap between the launch of the iM3, and the end of production for the current petrol-powered M3 – with the car maker one of only a handful to refuse to commit to a solely electric-car line-up.

BMW is set to drop the 'i' from the end of its petrol-powered model names – to avoid confusion with its electric cars, which add the letter to the start of the badge.

It now appears that nomenclature will continue to its high-performance vehicles with the discovery of the 'iM3' trademark filing.

While BMW has put M badges on electric cars before – in the i4 M50 and iX M60 – these are mid-tier 'M Performance' vehicles in the same vein as the M135i, M340i and X3 M40i, rather than the full-strength M3, M4 or X3 M.

About half a mile to a mile from home the car suddenly slowed down like crazy and started sputtering and making weird noises. When they got out there was also the smell of a sort of burning.

What do we have to do? They're going away on a trip tomorrow for 5 days, so this ideally needs to be sorted now, and in a way that doesn't risk their trip.

Will we be fine to just siphon the petrol out, and fill it with diesel? And swap the fuel filter? Or is this risky and do they really need to drain everything?",None,None,Parents put petrol in their (nearly empty) Peugeot RCZ and ran it for ~10 miles.
