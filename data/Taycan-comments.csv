TeslaWarrior,"Really impressive, I just hope they can find a way to bring the price down to something reasonable. I already thought the Turbo S was massively overpriced. Tesla's prices have come down significantly in the last year. I think it will be tough to find buyers at much over $250k. And I say that as someone who previously owned the Taycan Turbo S. But I bought that when the Plaid didn't exist, and the top trim Model S was around $120k. I'd like to see Porsche reduce prices on the Turbo and Turbo S models so that this updated one comes in at the same price the Turbo S is at today. Otherwise, I'd have a hard time justifying it versus just waiting for the eventual release of the Tesla Roadster. There's just only so far you can go with price arrogance in a market with declining prices.","<div class=""md""><p>Really impressive, I just hope they can find a way to bring the price down to something reasonable.

CowboyKnifemouth,"1. Agreed about the interior. I’m 6’3” and had a very hard time with the Taycan, but I do feel the lighter colors can really open it up from a sensory perspective. If you’re like me and end up cramped still there may be better EV options.
2. While the Porsche sound is off putting, you’ll likely grow to love the instantaneous response. As a former die-hard petrolhead, the bottomless torque is addicting. Might be worth a longer drive.
3. Let me guess - the old 15 highway near Miramar with the busted ass pavement? There’s less background noise to obscure a bad road and the ST is definitely less forgiving than the CT for road imperfections. Maybe try a CT and see how you feel?

UnknownQTY,"You’re not… wrong. 

I came from a Tesla Model S so to me, the Taycan is doing a lot to appease people who prefer the “Porsche driving experience” of an ICE vehicle and ease people into an EV. 

- There’s no single pedal driving mode. 
- Regen on its own is kind of pathetic, but it’s also baked into the manual braking much more heavily than other EVs so it FEELS like you’re more in direct control. 
- The car always “creeps” in drive mode, which is honestly a bit annoying coming from a “proper” EV.  Wish I could turn this off. 
- Ride is much stiffer, and steering WAY tighter than most EVs I’ve driven. You feel the road, feel the bumps and such. It’s like you’re REALLY driving, which isn’t the case for many EVs. 
- The fake engine/space mountain noise is ridiculous and I never, ever use it. 
- There’s definitely less space around the driver than my Model S, and the back seat is noticeably smaller. 

Coming from a Tesla the Taycan feels like a real car, not like a gadget with wheels. I like that, but I can also see an ICE can who’s not 100% bought in on buying an EV might be bothered by the “half measures.”","<div class=""md""><p>You’re not… wrong. </p>

koji52,"I can see the points you've raised. It's all about what you're looking for in a vehicle. The Taycan I think melds the utilitarian electric vehicle and superb handling of an ICE porsche together as perfectly as a single car can. Its a four door, electric family-capable car that handles like you would expect a 5000+ lbs Porsche to handle, and if you get a Turbo S does 0 to 60 faster than a GT3. It's never going to give you the sounds of an ICE vehicle nor the handling of a much lighter sports car. It's also not geared to provide the highest level of luxury...that's the market for other luxury brands. 

The taycan is much like life - lots of trade offs to find a balance between everything. For me it's, the perfect balance of practical utility, performance, and luxury.

That being said, I've gone around 60 around 20mph bends in the summer and because of all of the assistance systems (pdcc) and i would imagine rear wheel steering and the substantial weight, the car experiences no loss of traction, very little body roll, and is so smooth in and out of the corners.

[deleted],"I’m now in the market to buy a new car but I’m kinda at a crossroads. It’s between the Audi e Tron GT, Porsche Taycan turbo s, and the Tesla model s plaid plus.

flyingalbatross1,"I'm in a similar situation. My Porsche Taycan is in for battery fault investigations and going totally dead. Had to be loaded away.

Two months now and they're still waiting on tools from Germany to take the battery out to locate the fault. Never mind any further delay if it needs replacing. 

Two months and they don't even have the tools to look at it!

I'm making lease payments on a £140k car, I've got a loaner worth something like 1/4 the price....and crickets.

Nobody's looking after me. Not been able to speak to a single person apart from the poor mechanic doing the work on the ground. That's why I've gone to a premium car manufacturer - so if something goes tits up I get looked after.

Can't even get a reply to a complaint after 4 weeks. All I need is a person to help me sort things out. Like trying to talk to a brick wall.

Looks like lawyer up is next step. Unfortunately.","<div class=""md""><p>I&#39;m in a similar situation. My Porsche Taycan is in for battery fault investigations and going totally dead. Had to be loaded away.</p>

misfits-of-science,"Thanks, everyone, for the moral support. This whole thing has been such a nightmare.  Here are some answers to your follow-up questions:

&#x200B;

>Can you name & shame the dealership please. This will help others avoid + might just shame the dealer into changing tact, especially if someone from Porsche HQ is reading this.

I leased the Taycan TS from Porsche of San Diego. I still remember the thrill of buying my first Porsche 911 from this dealer back in 2000 as a twenty-seven year old. My experience with them has been almost uniformly positive until now.

The dealership has changed owners a number of times. Currently they're owned by Holman.

&#x200B;

>What options are you considering instead or are you just willing to have a worse car as a way to say “screw you” to Porsche? I get the desire, but you might be cutting off your nose to spite your face here.

I honestly don't know. I certainly don't *want* to walk away from Porsche. Their vehicles are fantastic. Sure, I could revert back to a 911 Turbo, but like someone else in the thread mentioned, once you go EV, driving a traditional ICE vehicle feels like driving in the Fred Flintstone era. There's really no going back from EVs for me.

&#x200B;

>The battery replacement which gives Porsche $48k seems sketchy. Not to mention what it’s going to do to your insurance premium going forward.

My insurance carrier AAA says that hitting a pothole counts as an ""at fault"" accident. Not good.

AAA has this concept of accident forgiveness for good drivers, so it shouldn't hit my premium next year. The real risk for me is that AAA says, ""Ok, we'll cover you this time and we won't penalize you on your next policy, but we're not going to insure you on another EV.""

This is a real risk that no one talks much about. From the insurance carrier's perspective, the fact that a 3mm pothole-generated dent warrants a $50k repair is absolutely nuts. I can see why they'd be tempted to drop EV coverage.

&#x200B;

>OP you messed up by letting your car stay there. Should have told them you want to drive the car until the battery arrives.

I actually tried this and they made some excuse about why that was impossible. Said they had already removed the battery and it would make more sense to wait for the new one. If I had to guess, behind the scenes their line of thinking was probably something along the lines of, ""We know the old battery is fine and the car is drivable, but we just made a big deal about how critical it is that battery be replaced -- so if we let him drive the car with the old battery and something goes wrong, after telling him in writing that the battery is no good, we could be in hot water.""

&#x200B;

>This may have something to do with Porsche cars being stuck in the ports.

The dealership is receiving parts and cars from overseas with no problems. There's even a little site you can login to and watch ship as it comes from Germany to your local port. But something about this particular battery shipment is just getting caught up in a maze of manager approvals and other bureaucratic nonsense.","<div class=""md""><p>Thanks, everyone, for the moral support.

Cic3ro,"I crossed-shopped both of these cars and went with the Taycan. Here is what it comes down to for me. Make a checklist for yourself and see what wins:

1. If you want the more practical of the two, go with the Tesla. It has more storage, more family oriented, and access to the supercharger network.

2. If you care about build quality, go with the Porsche. The Plaid I drive literally had exterior trim falling off. 

3. If you want the sportier of the two, go with the Porsche. It feels sturdier at higher speeds, is way better at handling, and feels better to drive overall. 

4. If you just want 0-60, get the Plaid, obviously. 

5. If you want the more unique of the two, go Porsche. You can literally customize your Porsche all the way down to the stitching. That's part of why these vehicles are so expensive, they are highly unique and customizable. The Tesla will be a dime a dozen. 

6. If you want the better looking of the two, go Porsche. 

7. If you want the better software of the two, go Tesla. The software experience is superior to the Taycan. 

8. If driving assistance matters to you a lot, go Tesla.

9. If you want the biggest flex factor, go Taycan. It's more exclusive, it's sexier, more unique. It will turn far more heads than a Tesla. 

10. If it's a car you're buying primarily for fun, with some practicality, buy the Porsche. If you are buying a car for practicality, with some fun, buy the Tesla. 


**Advice: DO NOT get the Tesla for the FSD. I had FSD, and it's more of a headache than it is a luxury. You're paying a lot to feel a ton of anxiety and constantly monitoring your vehicle as it 'drives itself'. It makes things more stressful, not less. I would absolutely not buy a Tesla for the promise of FSD, especially given it cannot be transferred to your next vehicle. At that point, just buy the Porsche until FSD is ready (if it ever is) since it will hold its value better.","<div class=""md""><p>I crossed-shopped both of these cars and went with the Taycan.

People who buy Taycans drive their cars and don&#39;t want stuff like FSD and other tech and people who buy Teslas don&#39;t care about build quality or handling.

I have a Turbo S and love getting behind the wheel every single day, I do NOT want FSD since that takes away the fun in driving nor do I want a car that can&#39;t handle as well as a Porsche.</p>

That said, I’m a little bored by Tesla at this point and wanted to try another electric so I bought the Taycan Turbo s.  

It has not disappointed, but does have its issues, and Porsche.  Ride quality- amazing.  Software and UI- not so much.

Execution23,"Before I say this, I am a Model S plaid owner and debated between a 4s and the plaid. You also have to realize that when you are talking about luxury very expensive cars like these, ""worth it"" isn't really what people are after. No $100k car is ""worth it"". 99% of cars are better values at that point. 

But realistically, the Porsche has only a few upsides that you need to prioritize over everything else in order for it to be the better fit for you as a driver. 

1) interior quality is better but people underestimate how nice the refreshed model s plaid interior is tbh. 

2) handling. This is the biggest one by far but I don't know what people expect with a hatchback sedan as big as the model s. 

3) track potential. Stock on both vehicles, neither are going to be amazing. With the right upgrades the MSP actually held the track time record for awhile but eventually the Porsche beat it. Either way it was close. 

4) looks. Porsche is beautiful, nuff said. 

5) customization if that's your thing

The model S plaid has a lot of upsides though too and this list is ultimately what led me to the plaid:

1) Performance IN DAILY DRIVING. Again the Porsche has slightly better track performance but that's a niche crowd. 

2) over the air updates are very useful

3) autopilot is still better than all of the autolane systems out there not to mention you don't have to option 3 separate things in the configurator like you do with the Porsche 

4) superchargers

5) the app is phenomenal. Like I can send directions directly from the app to the car with amazing navigation. Hell I can view my cameras within the app at any time from anywhere in the world. Pretty freaking cool. 

6) infortainment runs laps around any car but I'll say tech in general

7) at this point, drastically cheaper

8) space. This is the counter point to the above Porsche positive. You do have a lot of space inside the car with it being a hatchback 

9) insurance is much cheaper since Tesla has Tesla insurance that undercut every estimate I could find 
10) sentry mode and dashcam is a nice to have that I would hate losing

11) range is slightly higher in real world use

12) maintenance (even though minimal on both) will still be cheaper on the Tesla

13) parts are easier to get with the amount of Tesla's on the road

14) price to performance it isn't close

You have to be a true car enthusiast to want to spend double the cost for similar performance but the people that want those driving dynamics spring for the Porsche. And since value isn't the biggest deal with cars 100k plus, there is a market for each. Gotta love competition! One day I'll have one of each hopefully.","<div class=""md""><p>Before I say this, I am a Model S plaid owner and debated between a 4s and the plaid.

Can’t OTA that and you really can’t upgrade that as you can’t change geometry that much. If you own both you’ll see.

vincekerrazzi,"It’s really not a no brainer. Some people look for different things in a car. Some see a spec sheet and can’t get beyond that. A couple specific points: 

Tesla got the reputation for safety partially because EVs are superior in general in that way, and Tesla was there first(ish). 

Tesla currently has the advantage in scale, so also prices. That does not in any way equate to quality. Please take it from someone that has had many years of experience working with Tesla on a personal and professional level. 

Lastly. A non specific jab at car culture in general; buying a new car of any kind is essentially throwing money away, and Tesla is no better.","<div class=""md""><p>It’s really not a no brainer.
