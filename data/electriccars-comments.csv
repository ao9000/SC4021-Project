I'm very much pro union. But unions do slow down the growth of electric vehicles. It's a problem. It's also why Tesla doesn't want to unionize. Look at all the car companies that have unions like Ford. They're all struggling to get electric vehicles off the ground. They can barely stay afloat, and almost all of them are about to give up on electric vehicles for that very reason.

Like I've always said, if you truly believe in electric vehicles, and you want to see an electric future, you need to buy a Tesla. All the other car companies are treating it like a side hustle. They're setting themselves to get out once they go and gets tough and they're also not structured to handle any turbulence along the way.

People hate Elon, and so they buy things other than Tesla, but it has completely hurt the future of electric vehicles and impacted the trajectory. 

You already see Ford moving away from the F150 lightning and pulling their resources in other areas. With Tesla, they've invested every penny in electric vehicles.

mjohnsimon,"I used to inspect auto shops, specifically the auto shops you'd find in dealerships.

An overwhelming majority of these dealers/managers that I met and worked with were incredibly anti-EV whenever the subject was brought up. Plenty of them admitted that were it not for the direct requests from the manufacturers, they would simply refuse to sell them (with a few of them actually following through with it). 

The reasoning behind this Anti-EV mindset varied from politics, money, to just simply believing that EVs aren't ""real cars"". Many know that EVs make less money in the long run compared to an ICE, but many others simply don't care about the money because they don't want to be seen having ""Liberal propaganda"" on their lots.

CatalyticDragon,"I could point you to dozens of papers on breakthrough new battery chemistries which make similar claims. None of those are in volume production either. 

Making something which looks good in the lab is an important first step but doesn't always translate to commercial viability and Toyota hasn't demonstrated this technology is any closer than anybody else's. In fact we might argue it isn't.

What Toyota is doing here is taking some very speculative work by Idemitsu (an oil refining company I'll add) on solid electrolytes as the basis for a press release which they have relentlessly pushed to every possible news outlet. 

Make no mistake. This is just marketing, advertising. There is no battery. No supply chain. No battery factory. There are no products. Toyota and Idemitsu say they won't be able to produce anything until 2027 at the earliest. And even then only in *very* [limited numbers](https://www.thedrive.com/news/toyota-only-plans-to-make-enough-solid-state-batteries-for-10000-cars-in-2030).

Toyota need this marketing push because they are losing market share in key markets (US/China) and sales of their most popular models are now falling to EVs which are simply better cars and cheaper to own. Investors are getting anxious.  

Toyota desperately needs to calm investors and project leadership in a space where they simply do not compete if they want to protect their stock price.

But Toyota is a decade behind the curve because instead of developing clean vehicles they spent millions [lobbying governments](https://slate.com/business/2023/01/toyota-electric-vehicles-slow-why-hybrid-prius-bz4x-rav4.html) to slow this transition. It's going to be hard to catch up and I'm not seeing the sort of investments required for them to get there.

In 2027 we will have batteries which could potentially propel a car 1200 kms from a charge in \~10 minutes. I have no doubt. We already have batteries and chargers on the market which give you hundreds of kilometers of range in 10 minutes and we will be able to grow range significantly without any special breakthroughs required. 

Next-gen batteries and chargers in development right now will get us close to that goal anyway. 400/800V batteries, megawatt chargers, and 500 wh/kg batteries are all imminent. 

But a car with a range of 1200 kms is a niche item as few people want, or need, to be in a car that long without a break. The world doesn't need massive battery packs able to drive for two full days without stopping. The world needs cheap and reliable cars for people to get to work, school, and run errands. That means driving down costs with high volume, it doesn't mean exotic tech for a small run of 10,000 cars at the end of the decade.

Such high range cars will be made in volume production by it will be BYD and Tesla cranking them out. These groups have over a decade of relevant experience scaling out battery production, heavy integration, and have all the R&D dollars. They are at the forefront of battery technology, the first to scale lithium-ion batteries, the first with volume production of LFP batteries, and will be the first to bring sodium-ion batteries to volume production.

And the US lost that market to begin with by actually treating the American Consumer as idiots for buying their cars when Japan was building cars that didn&#39;t break every 5000 miles.  By the time they fixed it - damage done.</p>

ModsBannedMeX3,The “transition” isn’t happening. I’ve worked in new cars for 20 years. Very few want EV’s. You people are a small minority. Most people talk trash about EV’s. Most people hate the way they look. Most people hate the price. And the big fuel burning trucks you all hate so much. Best sellers. They can’t make enough Denali 1500’s and 2500’s for ol Boomer to take to his doctors appointment. GM sells more luxury trucks than anyone else. They are having record profits. See their stock buyback slap in the face right after their labor strike. GM isn’t losing. And neither is Toyota. Just love these deluded EV fan boy headlines.

[deleted],"Seems like a stupid prediction, considering in every instance that we can make a product fully electric the market loves it, and that product becomes dominant. It's kind of like arguing that cordless tools will never catch on one of that a construction site went in reality we would be happy to do anything other than run a generator and extension cords and deal with all the problems associated with keeping a generator running for hours at a job site or multiple generators for that matter. There's a lot of shit talkers that think they won't ever buy an EV, but the price advantage is only going to continue in favor of the EV and against internal combustion while at the same time the EV's will have more of the cooler features, so I think those are the same people that said they would never switch over to smart phones and are now like on their smart phone hooked on Facebook. When you consider a first generation, EV are already competing pretty well against internal combustion, and they're only going to get a lot cheaper and internal combustion has had decades to improve, but really hasn't, predicting only 30% adoption seems in the realm of pretty dumb.

Critical-Fix5229,"""You have zero privacy anyway,  Get over it.  (Scott McNealy, CEO of Sun Microsystems, 1999)""

I don't agree with the latter part of that statement, but it has been a fact of life since the early days of a vast, interconnected network of databases.  Note the date of the quote.

Every corporation wants, and therefore has, copious information about the people who use their products.  And when they seek consent, it is through lengthy privacy statements that pretty much nobody reads before agreeing to.  Combined with demographic science, very granular conclusions can be made about most people's predilections and behavior.  Driving habits are only a small part of information we are now used to some faceless corporation having accesss to.

Don't get me started on what insurance companies know about individual's health and health habits.  If you are American, you should be demanding European Union-style data privacy protections (at least).  You certainly don't have much (if any) privacy protections in pretty much everything you do.","<div class=""md""><p>&quot;You have zero privacy anyway,  Get over it.

TacomaKMart,">   in another sign that EV demand has cooled


I know it's this sub, and we're pro EV and you'd expect me to say this, but I don't think this is a ""sign that EV demand has cooled"". 


A big part of the magic of EVs is in home charging, and there's none of that magic for renters, most of whom are away from home. Get an EV as a rental and you're like an apartment dweller in a building that doesn't allow charging. 


We've seen plenty of horror stories in this sub from unsuspecting renters given excellent EVs and had a terrible experience.

That said, yeah, I have. I had what I believe to be a real human try to tell me (an EV owner) what range and what percent of charge spent gets spent on heating and so on. It's all based on lies they've been told. Frankly, we need more people to test drive them, see the ranges, understand how that changes (same as gas - if you are constantly gunning it, you spend more energy, whether your tank is chemical or electrons), and introduced to the idea of regenerative braking (extending range for stop/go traffic). It's not a political thing, it's just a better technology.

AND, the ceiling of the tech for dirty vehicles has basically been reached - advanced engineering to eek out %'s efficiency imrpovements. OTOH, EVs have a lot of promise ahead - new battery tech could insulate even further against the already low maintenance bills for EVs, and software can be written to alter performance profiles (as demoed with the Tesla, but the underlying tech that made it possible is shared across all EVs).","<div class=""md""><p>Correction, it&#39;s not misinformation, it&#39;s DISinformation. lies with an agenda.</p>

crazyhamsales,"Seems like every time I mention EV to people they say price is their first reason for avoiding them. I get it, I got a newer ICE vehicle last year because I just can't afford a larger monthly payment to get an EV. There are incentives and rebates available and those are great, but it doesn't affect my monthly payment any, it just means I'm paying less overall which is great but still I couldn't find a single EV new or used to buy that would have been a nice low affordable monthly payment to compare to my ICE vehicle loan.

I personally would LOVE to own an EV, I'm a low mileage driver, only 4.5-6k per year max. Most of my driving is in town, and we have multiple vehicles so we could always grab the ICE vehicle for a long road trip to visit family.

The problem is cost. Hopefully in the next 5-10 years the EV market will be a lot more competitive and I can make that switch down the road. I would love less maintenance, no oil changes, and just charging while it's parked in my garage for days at a time until I need to go somewhere. But it needs to be affordable, monthly payments, insurance, power costs, etc.

gmalis1,"If you're commuting to and from or have short vehicle trips, EV's probably are great.

But...

1 The grid CAN'T support EVs right now.  Estimate are that they need 1.2 million charging stations in the US.  We have just over 52,000 right now.  

2 Apartment/condo/big city homes with ""street parking only"" dwellers have issues with charging.  Not impossible if you can charge at work, but some can't do that either.

3 Charging anxiety IS a thing.

4 Like any other battery, there is degradation in charging over time.  And the vehicle devalues so much early (check prices for used Tesla's) that replacing the battery deck may not be economically prudent.  Now you have a $35K to $80K brick.  

5 Weather conditions.  Cold climates and extreme heat kill a battery and effect performance.  Charges that may have a range of 250 miles may only have 80 in sub freezing temps.  First hand knowledge.  Getting caught in a blizzard in stopped traffic will give you a heart attack wondering if you have enough charge to get you home as you're burning up those charged miles.

6 You're not saving what you think.  Several people have stated that charging their EV out of network was more expensive than buying gas in some areas.

7 Charging time.  Fill up in 5 minutes with my hybrid with a range of 525 miles or charge for 40 minutes for an 80% charge to 200 miles.  Doesn't make sense.  

8 Environmentally, you're not as ""green"" as you think.  Since less than 25% of all electricity is generated by nuclear, solar, wind or water turbine, the majority of energy you use isn't green renewable energy but fossil fuels.

Personally, the technology is the wrong technology.  They should have further developed hydrogen fuel vehicles.

Uranazzole,I think people who think EVs are not worthwhile are simply car owners who don’t drive many miles. I have cars long paid off and fill up a tank or 2 a month. Even that is cheaper than buying a new EV and installing infrastructure. Plus I do most of my own repairs so any new EV or even a new ICE car is not worth it. I wouldn’t trust a used EV because I still need infrastructure at home and wouldn’t take on an EV with a used battery due to the expense if it was on the verge of being bad and I bought the car. I can tell if an ICE car has a bad ICE engine or transmission but have no idea if a battery will last. And I’m not going to rely on a dealer or prior owner to tell me.,"<div class=""md""><p>I think people who think EVs are not worthwhile are simply car owners who don’t drive many miles.

- sometimes power grids do in fact go out.

The general direction we're heading is zero fossil fuels across the board.  80% of our current energy production today in the US comes from fossil fuels.  Tell me with actual numbers how you plan to carve out 80% of our energy production while increasing the energy consumption by a few orders of magnitude with 100% EV adoption for light duty vehicles. 

You can't just scream misinformation when someone points out that we have some serious feasibility issues here.  There are actual experts among you who work in the automotive and energy sectors that are screaming from the hilltops that the current plan isn't feasible. 

The reason hybrids look much more attractive is because they offer most of the benefits of an EV (at home charging, super low emissions), but also bring the flexibility and the warm and fuzzy ""this thing isn't going to strand me when it gets cold"" feeling that comes with ICE products.

nostrademons,"There's a large and concerted propaganda campaign being run by Big Oil.  Propaganda works.

Personally I'm a big fan of PHEVs - I just bought one, am happy with it, and I do think they are significantly more practical for the average non-early-adopter than a BEV at this point.  But they aren't mutually exclusive.  I ride on electric about 80% of the time and view it as a gateway to full EVs once the infrastructure gets a little better.

Many of the talking points like ""the grid can't support EVs"" or ""they cause more damage to roads"" or ""what happens when the battery wears out?"" are *true* but *irrelevant*.  The grid will build more powerplants to support the added demand; that is how the market works, we're going to have some painfully high electric bills during the transition, but solar has gotten cheaper than fossil fuels so the transition is inevitable at this point.

Sapriste,"Well you always have to follow the money.  Entire sectors of the economy are centered around private transportation.  We have consensus that private transportation is going to happen and that making it possible is a public good.  Many people own gas stations and major extraction companies own gas stations.  Transaction time at a gas station is less than five minutes with an opportunity to sell dry goods and food as well.  Gas tanks cost a substantial amount of money and you need more than one.  You also have to put up a bond in some states because they are kind of funny about you going bankrupt and leaving a pollutant in the ground.  An electric charging station isn't something you can necessarily swap for a gas station.  It takes longer to charge a car than the five minutes.  You want to charge near your destination.  It would be near pointless to drive 90% of the way to your destination and end up on a smelly, plague ridden bus for the last 10%.  So there will be big losers that are unaccounted for in the green plan.  

We need another big giveaway.  First give several universities grants to put economists, marketing professors, and others to think tank a business model for charging.  Second create a flexible subsidy to bribe gas station owners to swap their station for the charging business (maybe let them straddle both until gas is obsolete).  Third track the travel patterns of electrics and ICE to see if they are changing and what the rate of change is per area.

PineappleLunchables,The current framework for making BEVs rewards the suppliers of EV technology (based in Asia mostly) and favors manufactures of all BEVs (I.e. Tesla) over those manufacturing mixed fleets. My view is we will see the complete failure and bankruptcy of several traditional car makers because they will ever be able to make BEVs in a manner that sustains their high fixed costs during the transition to all BEV manufacturing. It will be interesting if these companies are propped up by various governments or be allowed to fail.,"<div class=""md""><p>The current framework for making BEVs rewards the suppliers of EV technology (based in Asia mostly) and favors manufactures of all BEVs (I.e.

azzers214,"So I tend to be more nuanced on this then the ""Yey BYD"" crowd.

There's a way to have China and US automakers compete but you have to be realistic about the environments for both products.  China still has extremely cheap labor it can deploy on any product and it can (and does) favor local industry over foreign.  If Ford drops a plant in China, you can bet China is still making sure BYD does better in that arrangement.

All the US needs to focus on is making sure the competition is relatively level ***amongst extremely capitalized industries***.  There's no ""small business"" here.  I would also prep a law so that any future bailout wipes out 100% of shareholders.  Part of what we see with Ford/GM is the moral hazard of making the most they can in the short term because they know the US can't afford to let them fail and they know it.  If you want to see them compete, give the shareholder actual risk of treating the firm like a wealth extraction tool.

But as it relates to China - don't protect industries from preventing a niche from being filled.  But at the same time, don't let China gut US industrial capacity either.  If you want to see how that ends, look at what happened to US hospital supplies during COVID.

TurretLauncher,"No  nation  on  earth  has  benefited  more  from  the  post-war  world  order  than  China.  From  freedom  of  the  seas  to  free  markets  to  free  exchanges  of  ideas,  China  has  harnessed  the  international  system  built by the U.S. and its allies to become a major world power. In the last 30 years with the global economy, more than 800 million  in  China  have  come  out  of  poverty.  But  despite  these  achievements,  China  does  not  want  to  play  by  the  rules.  Rather  than  help  preserve  the  global  system  that  allowed  China  to  grow  rapidly,  it  is  exploiting  its  vulnerabilities  to  gain  a  strategic  edge  over  competitors.  
 
China  has  no  intention  of  becoming  an  equal  partner  in  the  world  community.  They  do  this  by  cheating.  Just  as  the  Chinese  Communist  Party  does  not  want  rivals  at  home,  it  wants  to  fix  a  global  system  that  ensures  its  dominance  and  no  other  country.  This  includes  surpassing  the  United  States  as  the  leading  economic, political, and military power. To  achieve  economic  dominance,  China  has  resorted  as  I  have  said to cheating. This includes enacting policies such as stealing intellectual  property  from  the  United  States  and  other  countries,  forcing  transfers  in  exchange  for  market  access  to  technology,  imposing  discriminatory  licenses  on  foreign  companies  while  subsidizing  competing  Chinese  companies  that  try  to  operate  throughout  the  world,  and  intentionally  investing  in  American  companies  to acquire sensitive U.S. technology. Beijing is also intentionally overproducing steel and aluminum to drive  down  prices — we  call  that  dumping — to  make  it  harder  for  competing  producers  to  remain  profitable.  
 
Ultimately,  billions  of  dollars  and  millions  of  jobs  in  the  United  States  have  been  lost  because  China  cheats.  China  has  shown  no  sign  of  changing  its  course.  Instead,  it  has  launched  two  major  schemes  to  strengthen  its economy and expand its control of the global economy. First,  through  its  Made  in  China  2025  plan,  China  is  attempting  to  become  the  leader  in  high  tech  industries.  To  do  this  China  is  subverting  the  free  market  by  imposing  quotas  and  state  subsidies  to   prevent   competition   and   gain   self-sufficiency.   It   is   also   prioritizing  the  takeover  of  foreign  tech  companies  through  state-owned   enterprises.   Combined   with   state-sponsored   cyber   theft,   China  hopes  to  monopolize  high  tech  innovation  and  production  at  the  expense  of  the  United  States’  national  security  and  its  allies  and their national security. 
 
China  does  not  share  our  values.  We  have  long  since  seen  this  in  their  human  rights  records  and  now  it  is  obvious  in  their  trade  policies  as  well.  We  could  spend  a  whole  hearing  talking  about  the  abuse  and  human  rights  violations  of  China  with  its  own  people  and  different  religious  groups  in  China.  In  2001  we  encouraged  China’s  inclusion  in  the  World  Trade  Organization.  We  thought  China was evolving from the backward political theories of the past and  opening  up  a  free  market  and  rule  based.  We  were  wrong.  The  liberalizing  economic  reforms  we  expected  never  came,  instead  the  government increased its intervention in the economy. So  it  is  time  we  adapt  our  trade  policies  while  working  with  our  allies  to  confront  China’s  bad  behavior.  Beijing  has  proven  it  is  not  a  responsible  partner  and  a  fair  player  in  the  global  economy.  It  should  suffer  the  consequences.

As an electrical engineer I'm intimately familiar with the components currently in use, and by far the weakest link is the battery cells. Most complaints center around them, not the motors, not the controllers, and only partially the cockpit controls.

My investments are therefore in battery cell manufacturing of much superior cells than the NMC packs currently in use. Once we can buy a vehicle with cells that can charge from near 0 to 80% in the same time as it takes to fill up a tank, with no preconditioning or other pre-planning requirements, and at an overall lower cost, then hybrids and ICE vehicles will become a niche market.

latebinding,"One of the challenges with Reddit is that the most active users, the ones voting up/down, tend to be passionate for that topic.

So you downvote anything you disagree with.  Not just rudeness, but opinions you don't like, and even *facts* that you'd prefer hidden.

And that results in an echo chamber.  You only see views you agree with, and you think that's the world.  You punish (with reduced karma) anyone you disagree with, so they stay away, and you take the lack of visible valid disagreement as evidence there is none.

The facts are: 

* In 2023, EVs were 7.6% of U.S. vehicle sales.  
* EV sales are extremely regional.  In 2023Q3, about 24% of California vehicle sales were EVs, and 19% in Washington State (Seattle)... but only 3% of Michigan sales.
* All top six metro areas for EV Sales percentage are west coast; the top four cities are in  California.
* Places with much much higher adoption - such as China, northern Europe - do it through massive regulation, facilitated by cultures that *expect and accept* such regulation and control.

This is the real world.  In the long run, EVs will certainly become more popular as battery costs (and vehicle costs) lower and charging becomes easier.   But that's not like two years out; think five.   In the short term, hybrids seem to be doing well, because they don't have the charging limitations.

Are you *seeing* more EVs?  Of course.  8% this year isn't nothing.  But it's not half.  It's not even a quarter.  It's not even half-a-quarter.  It *should* be doubling quickly.  So let's try to keep the attitude in check.  Embrace the other data, recognize that *growth from 1% to 2%* is both impressive sounding (doubling) and still less than 97%.  We've got a long way to go.","<div class=""md""><p>One of the challenges with Reddit is that the most active users, the ones voting up/down, tend to be passionate for that topic.</p>

unique_usemame,"Are you asking for a high maintenance EV so you can do work? Or are you asking for a car that you don't have to pay someone else to work on?

If you are looking for something that you can do a bunch of work on then a Jeep 4xe is a plug in hybrid that lets you do all the usual jeep tinkering, it has gears, transfer case, oil changes and all the usual things that tinkerers want. The Jeep won't be very efficient, however.

If you want to avoid paying someone else to deal with issues that happen with spark plugs, oil changes, transfer case and gear issues, even brake pads... then I've got good news, get any popular EV. (brake pads do of course exist on an EV but with regenerative braking you are unlikely to ever need to replace them unless you go to the track or drive like you do)

When maintenance is needed on an EV it tends to be:

* tire wear.
* windshield washer fluid.
* breakages that happen from items the manufacturer put in to increase efficiency, such as fancy door handles.
* breakages that happen from the manufacturer trying to make the car seem luxury, such as frameless windows, falcon wing doors, multiple large led screens.
* breakages that happen due to the manufacturer trying to stuff lots of technology in to the car, believing that EV drivers are early adopters that want lots of technology. Things like auto-opening doors with ultrasonic sensors.
* issues from ""first year models"" where a manufacturer simply hasn't made many of that model as yet.

youngestEVer1,"Well first off, if you look at the beetle complete kit. Their site says it includes 5 tesla modules, yet they don’t tell you how many miles are on them (could have 100k miles!!), their photos show battery boxes for CALB Lithium iron phosphate cells, totally different, and they are trying to sell you a Tesla back without a BMS! I’ve heard horror stories where cars have burnt to the ground because someone didn’t use a BMS, and especially with Tesla modules. Also, thermal management is critical with those, heating them when you charge, etc. the charger they supply is slow, and not worth the money. A couple hundred dollars more and you can get a charger from me that’s 6.6kW instead of 2.5 kW from the same manufacturer! 

Anyway, I could go on and on, long story short, you’re not gonna get good support from them, also, they aren’t selling you the most updated stuff. 

If you want a kit, DM me and I’ll together the best kit for you for the best price.","<div class=""md""><p>Well first off, if you look at the beetle complete kit.

Pompous_Geezer_2Mo,"This is an example of journalism that states what is basically true, but in a manner that tries to manipulate your feelings. It's obviously an anti-EV piece and had it stated a different set of facts, would have had a less biased result.

Why are EVs ""on average"" less reliable? Because they are either being made by manufacturers that have never made EVs before or being made by companies that didn't exist and never made vehicles before (Tesla, Rivian, Lucid, Canoo, Fisker). It would be like an article stating that first model year cars are less reliable ""on average"". Duh! Of course they are. You never get all the kinks worked out in the first model year.

Never mind that EVs, unlike ICE vehicles, are undergoing (at least by some companies) uncharacteristically rapid evolution in an effort to lose weight, get better battery chemistry higher battery density, and more streamlined parts supply chains. Meaning that almost every year is like a first model year all over again.

There is no mention in the article of the counterpoint that EVs have many advantages over ICE. The following systems don't exist and therefore will not fail and have to be fixed: exhaust;  transmission (in most cases); fuel; oil; ignition; valve train, etc. If you use one-pedal driving, your brakes can last a long time. You don't have to wait for the engine to warm up before you get any heat. In fact, if you're smart, you can pre-heat (or pre-cool) the cabin while you're still plugged in. I could go on.

It was a BS article IMHO.","<div class=""md""><p>This is an example of journalism that states what is basically true, but in a manner that tries to manipulate your feelings. It&#39;s obviously an anti-EV piece and had it stated a different set of facts, would have had a less biased result.</p>

<p>On the level 2 in my garage, it takes me about 30 minutes to replenish all the energy that I used that day. Nobody with a home charger is going 0% to 100% every night. That&#39;s faster than my ability to go home, shower, change, and make a cup of coffee.</p>

<p>Even on a road trip it isn&#39;t too bad. 20-80s% in 20-30 minutes on a DC fast charger every 300 miles That&#39;s barely enough time to get appetizers at a restaurant. Half the time I&#39;m running to the charger to avoid overage fees</p>

johnnyg883,"I don’t hate electric cars. But in my situation they are not a good fit. But if someone wants one go for it. 

I think the biggest reason for the “hate” is the government shoving them down our throats, mandating them. If someone is on the fence about something, no mater what it is, and then they are forced to go in one direction they resist. People don’t like to be forced into things. 

Another problem is they are failing to live up to the they hype. We are being told they are at least as good as conventional ICE powered cars. The charge time is inconvenient, the range is not as good as a ICE powered vehicle and there is a large range fluctuation in extreme weather. And going back to the charging issue there have been problems with charging in cold weather. 

And there is the uncertainty involved in the longevity of the high dollar new technology cars. They have been around for less than 20 years. I know they have been around longer. I’m talking about the mass production models. So there is not a lot of real world data on how they hold up over the long term. And by long term I’m talking 15 to 20 years.

Ajk337,"My issue with them is a mix of things


Just because the car is electric doesn't mean I want an iPad to control basically everything in the cabin 


Also not a fan of the cameras inside of Teslas. I get that basically every car since 2013 has a cell phone modem in it to send data back to the manufacturer, but cameras inside the car? Can we at least get some privacy?


This is more of a new car thing, but they all seem to have low-pro tires with huge rims and no spare. This is yet another functionality hit.


Along with the increase in tech also comes with increased repair bills, and since some ev models are relatively rare, you're going to be waiting for parts for a loooong time


While I would no longer have to worry about gas, ev's cause me to have to worry about new shit that I really just don't want to. I have a ~10 year old Toyota truck. It has buttons in the cabin, the stock ride is soft (family has had various Teslas for years and the ride is extremely jarring), and it's not going to break. 


Another thing of note is that Tesla has the only functional charging network, but Teslas are guilty of all the functionality/user interface transgressions listed above, much less having to give Elon musk my money. So I'd be looking at a non Tesla ev.......which dont have a reliable network, which basically makes it a non-starter.


The traditional auto manufacturers all seem sort of directionless at the moment as well, which doesn't make me feel inspired by their products. 


Rivians are cool, but expensive, and I'm convinced that Amazon is going to buy them out and cancel the pickup trucks to make more prime vans, which will render the trucks ultra expensive paperweights at some point. This brings up another point. Despite having less moving parts, as best I understand, EVs are super expensive to repair. 


I'll be buying an EV one day, but it won't be for probably 5-10 more years at least, and not before car companies get some direction, and make a quality product that isn't compromised as much as today's ev's","<div class=""md""><p>My issue with them is a mix of things</p>

I have huge problems with them as well. Yes, it’s electric, but don’t try to use that as an environmental argument. That electricity is more than likely still fossil fuel based (which is ok by me, but hypocritical in the climate argument). 

Along those environmental arguments, those batteries require rare earth metals that are mined in Africa mostly. A continent not know for its environmental prowess. Also, what is the process of recycling those batteries once they are dead? An honest question as I do not know. 

Another problem is the weight of the vehicles themselves. Though they have incredible performance, their weight is substantially more than their peer vehicles. This will require technology to shrink the battery or increase infrastructure funding to compensate. 

I think within 20 years most of these problems will be solved. I think these vehicles are a part of our future.

NotFilip,"I can answer from my perspective as a 24 year old. I think that's still young. Electric cars are expensive compared to gas. I currently study in a different country and if I was to drive a cheap electric car back home instead of 5 hour drive it would be longer because I have to charge it multiple times. Of course Teslas and other more expensive cars can do that distance on one charge but a smaller cheaper electric car could not do that. Also there's a problem with whole car infrastructure as it is now. Just because the cars are electric doesn't mean it's better for driving daily. It's the same as gas. And last but not least is buying second hand. I can buy a gas car for 5k used and maybe invest another 2k for some repairs and be fine. If I wanted to buy an older electric car and needed to change a battery for example it's gonna be thousands.

red_dog007,"I think some concerns are legit, but would rarely be encountered if ever.  

For people who live in apartments I can see it being a pita.  Having to charge for 45 minutes every week or whatever would suck. And it's expensive to charge. It's only cheaper when you get a charger that actually charges full speed in relation to what the power consumption curve of the battery is.  I've been using rentals and it has only happened 1 time with plenty of dead chargers to be found.  Charging stations that as a whole are dead, or you have to back out and enter another stall. Charging can also be kinda confusing.  Like Chargepoint advertises 150kW but only if you have a 800V car and no one else is charging. How the hell are you supposed to know that? Otherwise it's 62.5 or 80kW charge speed, max.  Didn't find that out until later.  But because I didn't know I was pretty upset at the slow charging, but was in fact getting the most out of it. Or you have something like the Bolt that only charges 50kW. But this kind of stuff is basically a zero worry if you can charge at home.

Range anxiety can be real.  I had it in the Mach-E for sure. Range estimate was NOT accurate. Those miles always ticked off faster than you actually went.  To me, it seemed like for every 1.2miles of estimated range you'd get only actual 1 mile.  One time I had 100miles of range with 80miles to a charger I would prefer to have hit but I no'ped out and hit the one I was next to because I didn't trust the car.  In the Bolt, I don't get this kind of range anxiety. I find it more accurate and easier to extend the range if needed.  I would have hit that charger 80 miles away. I actually felt good pushing the Bolt.  I had 160 miles to home with 156miles of range.  I never stopped to charge and got home with 28 miles of range left. IMO this would be impossible to do with the Mach-E. 

I don't remember the name of the lady that worked on the first computer. The one whose co-worker coined the phrase ""bug"".  But she mentioned she saw this is a common phenomenon with all new technology.  

But yes, in short, IMO there are legit concerns.  More for people without easy access to chargers (say homeowners). A lot of concerns are nothing burgers or would not be an issue for >95% of the miles you put on the vehicle. Some people that drive a LOT some concerns would be more valid.  And concerns can also just be ""I don't want to deal with it."".

codefyre,"Hah, I recently had this conversation with my 19 year old son. He made two great points:

1. Only a tiny percentage of young people have access to garage chargers (the actual statistic, that I just Googled, is a smidge over 5%.) Most live in apartments, dorms, or with their parents. If you live with your parents, the garage space is theirs. If you live in a dorm, you're competing with thousands of students for the three chargers that exist on the typical campus (and lets not get into the ""prank"" vandalism that keeps them nonfunctional half the time). If you live in an apartment...charging just doesn't exist.

Without access to any kind of home charging infrastructure, owning a pure EV means spending an enormous amount of time sitting around in parking lots (because most of them also don't have the money to buy food in restaurants every time they charge their cars).

2. Road trips are the domain of the young, and electric cars still kind of suck for those. They don't have the range for the classic ""pile your friends in the car and hotswap the drivers seat so the car never stops"" road trips that young people love to take. Having to stop and charge every 200 miles isn't fun. When my son did a post-graduation road trip to Glacier NP last summer, his EV driving friends all left their electrics at home and they took my sons gas burner. None of those friends wanted to take their cars.

The shift is very real. My oldest was in high school when the first electrics were released, and she and her friends thought her Leaf was the coolest thing in the world when she got it. Each of her younger siblings has had progressively less interest in them. They aren't seen as new or interesting anymore, and the youngest just sees their faults. Remember, Tesla released its first sedan in 2012, which was 12 years ago. To an 18 or 19 year old kid, an electric car is about as ""new and novel"" as a cellphone.","<div class=""md""><p>Hah, I recently had this conversation with my 19 year old son.

On the other side people that use it for long commutes are saving thousands a year. Pays for itself in five years on some models. So just comes down to the individual.</p>

Sea_Bear7754,"30m here not exactly young not exactly old. I drive a 2020 Model 3 and love it, my 20 mile commute is roughly $0.85, and in the 4ish years I’ve only had the normal Tesla warranty stuff (control arms, a spring in the glove box, and trunk latch recall) and a set of tires. 

Then the car itself is incredibly fun to drive. I’ve driven sports cars and motorcycles most of my adult life and it has a higher performance feel to it mostly because of the acceleration combined with the heavier weight of the car. I traded in a 2011 Mustang GT for the Model 3 and I wish I did it sooner. 

Range is rarely an issue I’ve only gotten to 4% once and it wasn’t on a trip it was just me being dumb and not plugging it in the night before. I make a 200 mile round trip for work once a quarter and with charging it only adds 30min total but saves $46 compared to my fiancé’s ICE car. Worth it in my opinion especially since I usually want to stop half way through. 

Didn’t buy it for environmental reasons, I bought it because I test drove one and said “Oh $***” this is a fun car. Also not “loyal” to Tesla per se but I would compare a Tesla to and iPhone. Yes other brands have better this and that but the user experience is front of mind with Tesla.

BlackReaperG,"I don't necessarily hate them. They've been around since the late 1800s and are only being utilized for the sake of carbon taxing, hence why you see so many politicians pushing these new car laws and Telsa stocks. It's being utilized by a carbon credit system. Money.

Aka tax.

The restrictions will look like this. First you'll be legally allowed to drive 3 thousand miles max a month (to reduce pollution). So most people won't object to it and say it's fine, they drive way less they'll say. When it gets super strict it will be ""you can only drive 250 miles a week, anything over is carbon tax increase per mile"". That's where you get fucked and the side calls you selfish for not ""saving the world"". 

Don't want to comply? That's why these proposed bills have the words ""kill switch in car and penalty"". 

This will really help destroy a lot of poor people for sure.

This is also being implemented to how much waste and toxic pollution a company produces. The carbon is going to hold value, can be traded and sold like stocks. Al Gore wants to be the creator and minority holder of these credits. Kinda of like the owner of bit coin. The creator and owner are the richest. Scam of the century.

- The tech challened dont want to deal with much of the BS like downloading apps, knowing all the different charging methods, voltages, etc

-If u dont have a house, its a PITA and more costly to charge an EV. Even if u do have a house, it can be dangerous to charge inside ur garage. Now, can u even store ur EV in the garage to keep it out of the elements( this is big for me). 

- If u live in a colder climate(or extremely warm), like myself and much of the country, u lose a ton of range and if its cold enough, u may have to wait 30-60 minutes just for ur EV battery to warm up enough to take a charge and begin charging 

- EVs can tow but the range when towing is atrocious 

-If u buy a new EV, its expensive.  Buying used, u dont know the battery history, and EVs depreciate faster ICE cars and arent eligible for tax credits.

There is also the fact that Electric cars will not sigifently stop the increase of CO2 being put in the air. The manufacturing processes and material mining for electric cars are just as polluting. Then there is the lack of infrastructure to support, the extreme high cost of maintenence, physical limitations, the higher demand of electricity which will be created by burning more fossil fuels or the alternatives which destroy the Earth in alternate ways that also lead to early extinction.

Then there is the lack of infrastructure to support, the extreme high cost of maintenence, physical limitations, the higher demand of electricity which will be created by burning more fossil fuels or the alternatives which destroy the Earth in alternate ways that also lead to early extinction.</p>

<p>For me though it is the con. Push it out don&#39;t push it, people that are incentivised by greed and power continue to get rich. </p>

<p>Are electric vehicles evil? No. Is there a benefit in switching to electric vehicles? Eventually, yes.  But that will only happen when the demand by consumers drives the switch.</p>

WolfieNamira,"For me, repairability, costs, and most electric cars having touch screen controls that can be very distracting or cumbersome to use. The repairability argument can honestly be said for almost all new cars regardless of what powers them, but the batteries in particular seem to be very non-user replaceable as they're usually built into the bottom of the car, and cost tens of thousands of dollars if you want it replaced by the dealer (and usually, the dealer only who charges a premium). Lithium batteries by their very nature are consumables, they degrade over time so a replacement will most likely be needed eventually. I would rather just have better public transit so I wouldn't need to drive at all. it's safer, more efficient, and would reduce traffic as less people would be driving.

Important-Panda-8907,"The EV debate reminds me of the  Trump debate.  Mostly lies from those who have done nothing but parrot crap they hear from those who know nothing about politics or EVs. 
Sure there are still bugs to work out and more chargers to be built.  Most of all we need range.  I remember Elon Musk a few years back saying that we had to crack 400 miles to make EVs work well enough that the average guy would buy one.  He also used to say that most people charged at home shortly before he stopped supplying Teslas with a charging cord to use at home.  Was he wrong or just screwing us again for even more money to buy an item that should come with an EV?
He was right about the 400 miles per charge.  This amount of mileage would ease the pressure at charge stations as fewer people would need to use DC chargers except when traveling.  As it is now we with EVs must stop much too often. The 400 mile minimum would also give us a bigger buffer in the extreme cold.
I've been driving electric for 3 years now and sure there are growing pains.  New batteries that cost less and charge faster and will give us the 400 miles are on the way but it's going to take another five years .   My recommendation to those thinking about going electric is that they should not buy any electric car for the next five years unless you can get a cheap lease during that period.  This way you don't suffer the depreciation.  I would buy only when we crack the 400 miles per charge and full charges in less than 30 minutes.  There are batteries coming which may charge in ten minutes.   So many companies are filling patents on these batteries. If you want to own the car or truck then wait a few more years as the industry catches up with what we really need.  But, if your are going to buy a new ICE vehicle, don't buy an expensive one.  Buy one that will get you to that five year mark then switch to EVs.  Prices will be better in five years and all things related to EVs will also.","<div class=""md""><p>The EV debate reminds me of the  Trump debate.

As an adult I get next to no hate for it.  The vast majority approach with genuine questions.  One older guy (maybe 50's?) Approached us at a dcfc.  He had lots of very specific questions.  He wanted to see what it took to charge.  So I stopped the charge session and started over some could see how that worked.  He caught me not long after we plugged in sonhe got tonsee it pulling 244 kw and he was floored. I told him how long it took to dcfc and he couldn't believe it.  He wrapped his hand around the cable and was like how many amps is that? I did some math and I think it was around 250 amps.  He was like how is the cable not hot? I told him it's liquid cooled.  He asked if that hurt the battery.  I said it's harder on it than normal charging at home but that the battery is chilled by the ac system.  

The only hate I got recently wasn't even hate. It was that can't be real.  We had a snow storm in north Al. 4 inches of snow and single digit temps.

She was like insaw on the news were a bunch of Teslas had to be towed in Nashville.  In said yeah probably.  A lot of Nashville is apartment dwellers that don't have access to home charging. And that they probably didn't pay attention/believe the weather would get as bad as it did.  So they didn't prepare by charging before hand.  She said electric car don't work in the cold then.  I said they work fine. But they go through the energy a bit faster to keep the cabin and battery warm. She said my gas car has free heat. I said no. Your gas car converts twenty cents of every dollar into motion. The other 60 is wasted as heat. I said 98% of every dollar in my EV goes into moving the car.  She asked what about that other 2%.  I said that's usually lost in charging/discharging losses.

VicariousAthlete,"* first problem, you have to standardize the packs across many models and types of cars, which will compromise the design of those cars to some degree, increasing the mass of the car
* second problem, making the packs such that they can be removed and replaced dozens of times quickly safely will increase the mass of the car
* third problem, your battery and its health are a key factor in how much your EV will cost you, someone storing their EV in a cool place at low states of charge to keep their battery healthy will not want to pick up a ragged worn out pack at a swap station
* fourth problem: batteries are the biggest danger/liability in the car, do you want to risk a battery that is damaged or flawed being swapped into your car and causing a fire?
* fifth problem: the infrastructure for a battery swap station is many orders of magnitude more complicated than a charging station.  You need all the same charging infrastructure, plus underground caverns to hold batteries and machinery to move them around, charge them, and install them

johnnyg883,"The idea of swapping batteries has been floated. But there are tons of practical and logistical mountains to overcome. 

Cars would need to be redesigned to make the batteries easier to remove. The batteries take up a lot of space and are not light. In most cases they are designed to fit in shape of the car. To make them easier to remove the car would have to be designed around the batteries keeping removal a priority. 

The Tesla model 3 battery pack weighs in at half a ton. So you would need special handling equipment to move the batteries at the swapping station. You would need trained personnel to operate the equipment. If you try to automate the system it would require more standardizing of the battery, the car and even the swapping equipment. And a hell of a lot of cost for the automated swapping equipment. 

Each swapping station would need storage space for hundreds of battery packs assuming the design is standardized. To give you an idea of how many batteries would need to be stored. Look at a gas station and count the number of cars that are fueled in one hour. That would be your minimum number of batteries that would need to be kept on site. If the batteries are not standardized you will to figure out how many of each battery pack design to keep on hand. 

Then there is the issue of charging batteries at the swapping station.  You would also need the personal to handle the charging procedure. 

And because this is litigious society the question of liability is an issue. If you buy a new high end EV and swap out the battery and you get one close to its end of life you may only get half the range you should have. And if the battery explodes who owns the liability? Was it a flaw in the car? Was it a design or manufacturing flaw in the battery. Was the battery improperly handled by the swapping facility?  Since it’s no longer an OEM battery pack replaced outside a company owned / certified facility the finger pointing will last for years.","<div class=""md""><p>The idea of swapping batteries has been floated.

If you buy a new high end EV and swap out the battery and you get one close to its end of life you may only get half the range you should have. And if the battery explodes who owns the liability? Was it a flaw in the car? Was it a design or manufacturing flaw in the battery. Was the battery improperly handled by the swapping facility?  Since it’s no longer an OEM battery pack replaced outside a company owned / certified facility the finger pointing will last for years.</p>

Lorax91,"Nio is trying this, mainly in China. Their current equipment takes ~6-8 minutes per swap in online video examples, and you have to stay in your car during the process. If there are any cars ahead of you, you have to wait for them to finish, so it's really only effective for a low volume of users. Each swap station costs ~$500k, so adding multiple ones at a location would be expensive. Add the risk of mechanical failure that could cripple the operation, and this doesn't seem like a good idea for frequent swaps. 

There could be an advantage to making batteries easy to remove and replace by mechanics.

co-oper8,"*IF* battery EV is the dominant transportation method in 15 years, then I 100% agree with the battery swap station method taking over. 

I see people have listed the cons but I disagree. 
-batteries will not be owned by the driver, they will be owned by other companies. Thus the monitoring of age and battery health will be immaculate as it is an insurance liability. 

- the cost of a mechanized system would be great, however we can start by comparing it to the cost of making and stocking a regular gas station. Its not cheap.  Then move on to comparing it to the cost of oil refineries, oil drilling and transport. Both scenarios are mult billion dollar industries and they can manage. 

-everything in society is getting faster and eventually consumers will demand a 45 second battery swap. 

- the station will require unbelievable electrical supply. This is not a con and it 100% jibes with the learning about power grids that we need more decentralized power generation. Charging at home is the wrong time of day because most people are home at night when solar panels are off. Charging will happen in the daytime from massive pv solar arrays on the cheap land in between cities. Exactly where commuters tend to need a power up

- standardization will be required- this is not a con either its a pro. This will drive up competition and drive down price. Standardization and compatibility should be mandated by law in SO many industries. It would be a huge benefit to society. Look at cell and device charging cables from 1990-2000.

MeepleMerson,"I'm not sure.

Battery swapping is pretty quick (3-5 min), NIO does it with many of their cars. It has it's plusses and minuses. The pros are that it's a very quick way to ""recharge"" the EV, the stations could slow-charge batteries to prolong the pack life, the car always has a battery whose degradation is below a certain set level,  and the batteries can be swapped out with new battery tech as it becomes available.

The cons are: the sizes and shapes of the packs have to conform to one standard, you need many more battery packs than cars, you have to forgo the more advanced thermal regulation to enable the swapping capability, the stations are mechanically very complex and expensive, the stations can be swamped by changes and unable to give out packs, the cost per kWh for charge is very high, the footprint for the stations is pretty big if they accommodate more than 1 or 2 cars, and you need to swap station cells requiring a distribution network and trucking to support. Also, despite it taking 3-5 minutes instead of 15-30 for a fast charger, you incur the same cost associated with diverting to the site.

The problem is that, in areas where people have access to charging where they park, the use of public charging represents a tiny fraction of charging. The need for faster but higher cost public charging probably isn't there.","<div class=""md""><p>I&#39;m not sure.</p>

edweiss611,"There are several problems with the idea of replaceable batteries:
1. Probably the biggest problem is that manufacturers have been utilizing the batteries as part of the overall stiffness of the vehicle. A replaceable battery would mean that  a completely different approach would need to be taken to vehicle design.
2. Standardization. There would have to be a single standard for the design of the batteries and how they are removed. Seeing how long it is taking to get to a single standard for charge ports, It's hard to imagine that different car manufacturers will agree on a set design.

[deleted],"I think it’s too early to standardize. We don’t even have solid state yet.

What if battery tech improves drastically in five years? 5x faster charging, 3x range, half the weight, no fire risk, etc?

If we’re standardized on a form factor, voltage and connectivity that is incompatible with the improvements, suddenly you either have to upgrade the swapping stations and render most existing EVs obsolete, or stick with outdated technology.

Once we have a battery pack that can reliably double the range of the average ICE car, then maybe carmakers should get together and talk about making a standard. 

Until then, it’s important that carmakers compete on battery technology.","<div class=""md""><p>I think it’s too early to standardize. We don’t even have solid state yet.</p>

It’s an idea of someone who never turned a wrench because every time you pull a component, something breaks.

This opens the pandoras box to battery theft or fraud, because this is much much more expensive than a cat coverter. You get it swapped to a dummy battery. Next swap station wont accept it because its damaged or unusable. You are out $40,000. No station is just going to give out high value inventory like that without having insurance or leverage for situation like these.

SirEDCaLot,"Yes it is true.  

If you're a power plant owner, that's burning hundreds or thousands of tons of fuel every day, efficiency is important.  If a new technology gets you even 1% more efficiency out of your system, that is worth millions, even if it's huge and heavy.  Thus even a coal power plant can be 70-80% efficient in terms of amount of chemical energy in the coal that's productively used and output as electricity.  

In a car, things are different.  There are limitations in the size and weight of the engine, how much it can cost, and how much power you want it to make.  Something that doubles the weight and triples the cost of the engine but adds 5% more efficiency isn't worth doing.  

The result is that most ICE motors are around 20-35% efficient.  Some very modern new ones hit the 40% mark in good conditions, some of the time.  But the majority of the chemical energy in the fuel is wasted as heat that's bled off into the environment.  And the only way you get anywhere near 35-40% is with a ton of complex addon technologies like variable valve timing, turbochargers/superchargers, electronic fuel injection, etc etc that all add to the moving parts count.  

-----

In electric cars, the 'wall to wheels efficiency' (that is, counting charger losses, battery efficiency, power converter efficiency, motor efficiency, etc) total is around 90%.  90% times 80% is about 72% total fuel to road efficiency for coal vs. 30-40% for ICE.

That_Car_Dude_Aus,"So a stationary generator can hit 35%

Rest is heat, NOx, and other bullshit.

An average car, on its combined rev range, is 15-20% efficient. You don't always drive at optimum RPM.

So you're losing up to 85% of your potential energy.

So take coal at 100% of potential

Your coal fired power plant is [around 33% efficient ](https://www.energy.gov/fecm/science-innovation/office-clean-coal-and-carbon-management/advanced-energy-systems/transformative#:~:text=The%20average%20coal%2Dfired%20power,States%20operates%20near%2033%25%20efficiency.)

So you get 33%

You'll lose [around 10% of *that* energy to transmission losses](https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.abc.net.au/article/11051718)

So 33% × 0.9 = 29.7% of the coal power potential is making it to your car.

You lose [around 16% to charging ](https://www.greencarcongress.com/2018/09/20180905-fotw.html)

So 29.7% × 0.84 = 24.948%

And an EV motor is [85-90% efficient ](https://www.energycouncil.com.au/analysis/evs-are-they-really-more-efficient/#:~:text=An%20EV%20motor%20is%20around,coal%2Dfired%20energy%20to%20power.)

So 24.948% × 0.85 = 21.2058%

So considering that some poorly timed cars can get 15%, and *highly tuned economy cars* get 20%, you're still getting 1.2058-6.2058% better than ICE

Plus despite its name, a lot of modern coal stations are super clean, they have super intense scrubbers, filtration, and recirculation to try and keep bad stiff out of the atmosphere.

Bevan, your neighbour, who flogs his car, runs the cheapest fuel he can (91RON/89AKI), hasn't changed his spark plugs in 10 years, and pulled his cat off because he ""thinks it sounds better""

<p>You&#39;ll lose <a href=""https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.abc.net.au/article/11051718"">around 10% of <em>that</em> energy to transmission losses</a></p>

<p>So 33% × 0.9 = 29.7% of the coal power potential is making it to your car.</p>

<p>You lose <a href=""https://www.greencarcongress.com/2018/09/20180905-fotw.html"">around 16% to charging </a></p>

<p>So 29.7% × 0.84 = 24.948%</p>

<p>And an EV motor is <a href=""https://www.energycouncil.com.au/analysis/evs-are-they-really-more-efficient/#:%7E:text=An%20EV%20motor%20is%20around,coal%2Dfired%20energy%20to%20power."">85-90% efficient </a></p>

<p>So 24.948% × 0.85 = 21.2058%</p>

<p>So considering that some poorly timed cars can get 15%, and <em>highly tuned economy cars</em> get 20%, you&#39;re still getting 1.2058-6.2058% better than ICE</p>

<p>Plus despite its name, a lot of modern coal stations are super clean, they have super intense scrubbers, filtration, and recirculation to try and keep bad stiff out of the atmosphere.</p>

<p>Bevan, your neighbour, who flogs his car, runs the cheapest fuel he can (91RON/89AKI), hasn&#39;t changed his spark plugs in 10 years, and pulled his cat off because he &quot;thinks it sounds better&quot;</p>

<p>Well, he&#39;s probably pushing more shit into the atmosphere per kg of petrol than a coal plant is putting out per kg of coal.</p>

That said, there's a *huge* gap in the market for an electric convertible and no, the new Roadster isn't going to fill it. I'm thinking MX-5-to-Boxster class and the Roadster is several times over pricing itself out of that range.

which only represents between a doubling and a tripling of efficiency. This is mostly because batteries require more materials on top of the already significant metal content of a car, which require energy and carbon intensive processes to make, and that the electricity consumed is still being generated from fossil fuels, including popular-but-waning coal plants.

When your offering isn't cost competitive with the car sitting right next to it let alone the other cars across town, the average person isn't going to buy it because it is ""green"" or cool or because you called it a Mustang. This isn't much different from the other makers but Ford really made fools of themselves kind of stumbling around changing prices and programs randomly as demand shifted. Traditional manufacturers are going to have to take huge hits to make EVs work just like Tesla did but shareholders demand immediate satisfaction.","<div class=""md""><p>A lot of the forecasts/expectations were just not realistic.

wewewawa,"Ford's (F.N) F-150 Lightning electric truck shows how bullish forecasts got corralled.

Buoyed by enthusiastic early demand for the Lightning, Ford in August added a third work crew at its historic Rouge assembly complex in Dearborn, Michigan, to triple the production rate of the electric pickup truck to 150,000 vehicles a year.

But in October, Ford cancelled the third shift, conceding that demand for electric F-150s was not enough to sustain the planned production pace. About 700 workers were furloughed.

In China, Europe and the United States - the main EV markets - electric-vehicle demand is still growing faster than demand for vehicles overall.","<div class=""md""><p>Ford&#39;s (F.N) F-150 Lightning electric truck shows how bullish forecasts got corralled.</p>
