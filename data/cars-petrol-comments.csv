"In theory, these kinds of things should help drive consumers to look at miles per KWh.  Right now, we’re only looking at range and charge times, but now that people are seeing KWh prices and doing the math, it’s the next logical step.  Ultimately in addition to focusing on building a bigger fuel tank (more range) people can also attention to their cost per mile.

Not long ago I ran some comparison numbers of a Hummer EV vs a Lightning, and the Lightning cost per mile was significantly lower since it’s literally a ton lighter than the Hummer.  And the range is similar even though the Ford’s battery is 2/3 of the capacity of the Hummer battery.","<div class=""md""><p>In theory, these kinds of things should help drive consumers to look at miles per KWh.

"""How much will I save if I switch to an EV?"" is an interesting question! It takes three variables: cost of electricity; cost of gasoline; and efficiency of the EV.

Setting aside purchase price, maintenance costs, and insurance costs, and assuming you charge at home (residential rate)-

**An EV will give you the cost-equivalent of between 18 and 200 miles per gallon, with an median of 63 miles per gallon-cost**

Quite a spread, huh? Here's the range:

On one end:

- Tesla Model 3 (.25kwh/mi) is the most efficient vehicle
- Washington State (~10 cents per kwh) has cheapest electricity
- compared to California (~$5/gal) with the most expensive gas

...gets you 200 miles per (the cost of 1) gallon

On the other end:

- Porsche Taycan Turbo S (.5kwh/mi)
- New Hampshire (electricity ~33 cents per kwh)
- compared to gas in Texas (~$3/gal)

...equals 18mpge.

In the middle:
 
- median EV efficiencity (Mustang Mach E @ .33kwh/mi)
- at US Average electricity cost (~16 cents per kwh)
- compared to US Average gas cost ($3.50 right now)

So the change is actually to remove a 5 year intermediate time when plug in hybrids were a transition between combustion cars and EVs.

"Alright, I know you guys are too stupid to read beyond headlines and do your own research so let me break it down a bit for you.

The old plan was to ban ICE-only vehicles from 2030 and from 2035 all new vehicles would have to be ""zero tailpipe"" emissions.

Between 2030-2035 it would be allowed to have a transition period where ICE vehicles with ""significant zero emission capability"" i.e. Plug-in Hybrids, would be allowed. The exact definition of this was to be defined at a later date.

The new ruling gets rid of the transition period and puts the ICE-ban back to 2035, same time as the switchover to EV only.

Realistically what does this mean? Very little to be honest.

This year more than 35% of car sales were either BEV or hybrids so that falls within the cars that would have been allowed 2030-2035 anyway. And Sunak himself said during the speech he predicts ""the majority"" of new cars in 2030 to be EV.

Also, most manufacturers are pretty much aligned with this anyway. And an not going to sell ICE-only vehicles be 2030. However! Manufacturer's generally includes Mild Hybrids in that which wouldn't satisfy the ""significant zero emissions capability"" threshold so there is a bit of nuance there.

But the just of it is that the only difference is that you can now buy a petrol and diesel vehicle between 2030-2035. In the long term that doesn't mean much, I can't imagine a single scenario that affects the ordinary public (so not sports cars and super ars and long distance lorries) where people should be buying a diesel vehicle in 2034 for example as there are no doubt 1,000,000 better alternatives on the market.

What it might affect is the person buying a Diesel or Petrol vehicle in 2025 wondering if it's worthwhile and will be obsolete in 10 years or not.

It's also worth noting that in any case the sale of used petrol and diesel vehicles wasn't set to change.

All in all its a very strange situation, it doesn't affect the OEM's so much, it won't impact buying habits too much because EV and PHEV sales are already shooting ahead regardless. And it does more to piss off his own MPcs than it does to Influence the public.

It's a political move designed to align with the likes of people upset about ULEZ for example. The justification given was about ""choice"" and ""cost"". Which IMO is stupid and short sighted. The cheapest new car on sale today is a Kia Picanto, that is £13,600. The same car in 2016 was around £8,500 which equates to £10,500-ish after inflation.

So that's already well above that. Fuel also was about £1.10 in 2016 and now it's around £1.50-1.60. So whatever the govt has done since then has made buying and running new cars more expensive than ever and it's nothing to do with EV's.

The train of thought almost seemed to say ""we're doing so well we don't actually need to try so hard"" but hadn't stopped to think perhaps was doing well because the UK was quite active on reducing emissions.

In fact the UK is one of the top in the world when it comes to percentage reduction in emissions since 1990.

TL;DR - political posturing, the changes won't affect much because A) manufacturers (of cars ordinary people buy) are not going to be making ICE-only vehicles in 2030 and B) People won't want to buy them anyway.  C) Sunak knows this and it more about sending a message and winning votes than anything","<div class=""md""><p>Alright, I know you guys are too stupid to read beyond headlines and do your own research so let me break it down a bit for you.</p>

In the long term that doesn&#39;t mean much, I can&#39;t imagine a single scenario that affects the ordinary public (so not sports cars and super ars and long distance lorries) where people should be buying a diesel vehicle in 2034 for example as there are no doubt 1,000,000 better alternatives on the market.</p>

<p>What it might affect is the person buying a Diesel or Petrol vehicle in 2025 wondering if it&#39;s worthwhile and will be obsolete in 10 years or not.</p>

<p>It&#39;s also worth noting that in any case the sale of used petrol and diesel vehicles wasn&#39;t set to change.</p>

<p>All in all its a very strange situation, it doesn&#39;t affect the OEM&#39;s so much, it won&#39;t impact buying habits too much because EV and PHEV sales are already shooting ahead regardless. And it does more to piss off his own MPcs than it does to Influence the public.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a political move designed to align with the likes of people upset about ULEZ for example. The justification given was about &quot;choice&quot; and &quot;cost&quot;. Which IMO is stupid and short sighted. The cheapest new car on sale today is a Kia Picanto, that is £13,600. The same car in 2016 was around £8,500 which equates to £10,500-ish after inflation.</p>

<p>So that&#39;s already well above that. Fuel also was about £1.10 in 2016 and now it&#39;s around £1.50-1.60. So whatever the govt has done since then has made buying and running new cars more expensive than ever and it&#39;s nothing to do with EV&#39;s.</p>

<p>The train of thought almost seemed to say &quot;we&#39;re doing so well we don&#39;t actually need to try so hard&quot; but hadn&#39;t stopped to think perhaps was doing well because the UK was quite active on reducing emissions.</p>

<p>In fact the UK is one of the top in the world when it comes to percentage reduction in emissions since 1990.</p>

<p>TL;DR - political posturing, the changes won&#39;t affect much because A) manufacturers (of cars ordinary people buy) are not going to be making ICE-only vehicles in 2030 and B) People won&#39;t want to buy them anyway.  C) Sunak knows this and it more about sending a message and winning votes than anything</p>

"It doesn’t make much sense to me and feels like it’s just to to appease people who don’t understand the ban is on new cars only. With the old deadline, in reality, we would be looking at 2035-2040 before ICE vehicles would really start to be phasing out. Ie 15 years from now.

"The real issue here is that Sunak and the Tories are in the back pocket of the energy companies who want more drilling licenses in the North Sea.  By rolling back the ban by 5 years it takes away the urgency for auto makers to invest in R&D for better battery technology and for better electric cars.

Ford have already criticised this.  Why? Because Ford along with other makes would go to the City to raise finance by way of loans and shares to invest in re-tooling and R&D with a fixed period when those loans can be repaid.

If you know by 2030 you can only sell electric cars then you know your current range and new ranges of electric cars will be your best sellers as you won't be competing alongside old Ice based cars from competitors as everyone is on the same level.

As mass production of these models overtakes Ice cars the prices will come down.  New battery technologies will improve and those companies that run public charging points will also be able to raise finance to speed up the roll out because they know from 2030 the demand will be that much higher.

Remove those certainties and we stagnate. We lose inward investment and the infrastructure remains woefully inadequate.

Meanwhile Sunak and Truss stuff their back pockets with full brown envelopes of cash from the likes of Shell and BP who go and create more greenhouse gasses dredging the north sea for fossil fuel.","<div class=""md""><p>The real issue here is that Sunak and the Tories are in the back pocket of the energy companies who want more drilling licenses in the North Sea.

"Broadly speaking I don’t think the very poor should have to own cars to participate in society. We should inject massive amounts of energy and resources into public transportation. That said I believe EVs will be a better option for the poor in the near future. 

A model 3 should have a useful life of at least 20 years in terms of battery degradation. Obviously it remains to be seen if 300k miles is the norm for these vehicles, but that is the stated minimum. A car built with 250 miles of range could lose 50% of that and still provide value in an urban environment. A new 55kw battery in ten years will cost 5k at most. My guess is that there will even be after market components that can cheaply replace the original computers and display to keep these cars rolling on the cheap. 

Hardly matters though since the law is just dealing with new vehicles so there will be plenty of used ICE vehicles for at least another decade to satisfy the needs of the less well off.","<div class=""md""><p>Broadly speaking I don’t think the very poor should have to own cars to participate in society.

"I honestly think a lot of folks are getting it wrong when it comes to Lotus cars. 

I think Lotus is all about making engaging sports cars that offer a sublime and unmatched driving experience. 

In the past they used lightness to get there, but look at something like the Evora which is around 3100-3150lbs. It's only a touch lighter than a C5/C6 Corvette but it honestly feels like it's about 800lbs lighter due to how nimble and agile that car feels.

With how much control you have over EV's with motors in each wheel, instant torque, torque vectoring, etc. I think there's A LOT that can be done to dial in unique and engaging driving dynamics, which is *really* what Lotus is good at.

"The article in question is just regurgitating information Lotus has been steadily given us since the Geely acquisition and the subsequent reveal of the Evija.

Somehow this makes a lot of people in here very unhappy, that Lotus of all brands will switch to EV manufacturing within the next 8 years. But I’m also seeing a lot of people just not ‘in the know’ of what’s going on in Hethel.

Geely is basically giving Lotus a blank check. They want a sportscar brand in their portfolio, and Lotus is definitely a strong brand for them. But it has weaknesses: Only 1 car is available worldwide, which is the Evora. The others are just subject to your country’s safety rules. Another weakness is cash. Lotus builds around 1500 - 2000 cars a year. They are all handbuilt in Hethel, which is nice and charming, but not that great for sales. The Evora in the US costs more than its Porsche equivalent, which might be a hard sell. No big sales mean no real dealer network, which just feeds into this circle. Lotus is actively working on recreating a dealer network across the world, starting with the US, but that will start with the new car.

Lotus is working on those in its Vision 80 timeline, which was announced in 2018 when they celebrated its 70th anniversary. Out of that the Evija came, a halo car and a taste of what’s to come. Since then, they also announced a new car is coming. Built upon a new platform currently being developed, it will have a V6 at launch and more creature comforts so its more able to used daily. Its expected this will be a new Esprit. Eventually, other powertrain versions might be released, with them looking at inline 4’s. The Evora will be phased out when this car arrives, as they’ll exist within the same pricerange.

What about the Elise and Exige? Well, those are up next. Chances are that indeed, these will launch with an full EV powertrain, but mixed messages have been sent with there also being a ICE version available. But seeing as these are more than 2 years away, things might change.

A lot of people here are also bringing up how Colin Chapman is probably turning in his grave. He did say ‘light is right’ and ‘to go faster anywhere, add lightness’ after all. Yes, those are the marketing lines, and they were a means to an end to explain why they lacked in raw horsepower. Sure my Elise goes like stink with its 750kg’s, amazing handling and 122hp engine. But its the handling that really does it. And that’s what they’re carrying forward.

An all electric Elise, that they try and keep the weight down as much as possible, but with some decent electric motors and fantastic handling and balance? That might be an amazing feat. No it won’t weigh 750kg (or 950 for the toyota engined models), but I have the utmost confidence they’ll make the best of it. Is it a bad move? Time will tell, but staying on health support and still producing the Evora, Exige and Elise for another 10 years won’t do. 

I’m sorry if this comes off as rambling, or some bias fanboy defense. I’m really passionate about this brand and the Elise I own today was my dreamcar since I played Gran Turismo.

"When I was in an apartment in LA, I would typically drive 1 hour (on a good day) to my parent’s house in the suburbs to do major work in their massive garage. Minor work could be done quickly in the covered apartment garage. But one time my water pump failed and in that specific car a water pump+timing job was almost full day for a professional mechanic, up to 2 days for a recreational one. There was no way I was going to tow it to my parents house and I certainly couldn’t drive it more than 1-2 miles before the engine would overheat. So I sucked up my pride and went to a locally-owned mechanic for a quote. While chatting with him and explaining the car (it’s heavily modified), I mentioned that normally I would do it myself but didn’t have space to do it. Surprisingly the dude paused, then told me as long as I was gone before he opened on Monday, I could park in his back lot first thing on Saturday and do whatever work I needed. No tools provided, no restroom available, but it was a dedicated space off the street. I’m guessing it was refreshing for this dude to talk to someone who actually knew wtf they were talking about with car maintenance. I took him up on the offer, brought all my tools and parts and got it done in 1.5 days. I would have stayed there all night if I had to. I even brought my bike so I could go home when I needed to eat or use the restroom. It’s one of the nicest things a stranger has done for me and to this day I regret not leaving at a minimum a 6 pack of beer or something.

Nowadays I’m in another state and I have my own garage and a driveway. I offer it up to my car buddies that need to do work, in order to pay it forward for all the times I’ve been helped or offered a space. Hopefully you have some friends locally that can do the same.

"22 city, 26 hwy.  110K.   Back in the 1970s, 80s, 90s and 00s when gasoline spiked there was a brief love affair with smaller and high MPG vehicles.   

Only Datsuns, VWs, Toyotas and Subarus were there to fill the bill.  A minimal used car market for these and my new 78 Subaru cost $3400.  Small American cars were horrible and poorly made.   Tested a 78 Chevette which broke down in the street in front of the dealership. 

Looking at history the used car market for high mileage cars will spike.  New cars with high gas mileage will as well.   

Great deals on guzzlers.  Mysteriously these same cars will be stolen in large numbers and found burnt in outlying areas to collect insurance. 

Putting 40K to 60+K into an EV is not necessarily a sound financial decision.   Cost of electricity will rise as the new prices of natural gas get factored in.

"I work from home, my wife's car is a hybrid and gets 50mpg. My ""daily"" is my 1998 Mazda B4000. it's lucky to get 17MPG. but I've owned it 6 years, it cost me $2500 to buy $35 year to register and like maybe $100 in insurance. Repairs/maintenance have been less than $500/year. And there is no replacing a truck with anything other than another truck. and there is no way I could buy a truck, with as little as I drive, that would get enough better fuel economy to justify the expense. 

Even a ford maverick hybrid gets 42mpg (highest MPG and Lowest priced truck on the market), If I calculate for the WORST mpg I get, 14mpg, that's 28 mpg difference. at $10 a gallon, and an out the door price of say 25,000. I could sell my truck for about what I paid for it, since it's salvage titled, so a difference of $22,500 based on purchase price alone, and my average driving miles, of say maximum 4000 miles a year, at $10/gallon the difference between my truck and a brand new maverick, is $1400/year, or 16 years to cover the difference. and that's just the purchase price, not to mention the increased insurance, taxes, etc. 

That being said. My wife's car we did replace with a hybrid this year. right before gas prices started going insane (was sill right at $3/gallon). But the scenario was a bit different. First, We paid $8k for her her previous car, and were able to sell it for $10k. She got maybe 18mpg in her car (2011 ford escape). and we bought her new car for \~30k otd, and paid off 10k immediately, so a net price of 20K, the taxes are a bit more, but for what ever reason the insurance was cheaper, and it gets 52mpg average. She also drives a lot more 8,000-10,000 miles. fuel difference at $10/gallon is $2,910 or a pay off just shy of 7 years. BUT the transmission in the previous car was about ready to shit the bed, so say $3000 in known repairs, 5.8 years, on the low end. If she drives 10k miles, between 5.5 years and 4.6 years. But the main reason we traded cars, (besides the transmission issue, which we would have just gotten fixed) is we bought it for her to drive her dad around in to drs appointments, but he passed away like... a month and a half after we bought it, so yeah, to many sad feelings attached.","<div class=""md""><p>I work from home, my wife&#39;s car is a hybrid and gets 50mpg.

I have ordered a Kia EV6. I didn’t want to buy a new car at least for a couple of more years, but I’m being forced into it.

"No. As bad as it looks, when you figure out the actual cost, it is nowhere near car replacement levels. 

I get 25 mpg out of my Outback and commute 70 miles a day (35 each way). At our current price of about $6/gal (California), I am spending about $100 a week for gas.

"38MPG (10th-gen Honda Civic).

There isn't really a comparable ICE vehicle with better gas mileage. So I'd really only think about trading it in for a hybrid or EV. 

However, at local energy prices ($5/gal v. $.24/kWh), the cost to trade up negates the efficiency savings for the *vast* majority of vehicles. 

Take a comparable EV sedan. Even the most efficient models - base Tesla Model 3 or Hyundai IONIQ 5, with efficiency of .24kWh/mi. They each cost $42k USD - $23k more than I paid for my Honda (which is ~ to what it is worth now, too). As such, I'd have to drive the EV **271,000 miles** to break even on the trade.

Even if my energy prices were similar to Finland - near the highest gas price and lowest electric price in Europe, $10/gal and $.08/kWh respectively - break-even on moving from my Honda to a Model 3 would still take around **100,000** miles.

I drive about 5,000 miles a year, so even then I'd still have to keep my car 20 years for the EV to be the more frugal option.

This is all assuming similar cost of ownership - IE no cost of financing, no difference in excise taxes, no difference in insurance rates, no difference in maintenance costs, no battery replacement needs after two decades regular use, and that a Tesla is as reliable as a Honda Civic. To say nothing of the money I'd gain if I took that $23,000 and invested it.","<div class=""md""><p>38MPG (10th-gen Honda Civic).</p>

I doubt there is a need for a ban. As less and less petrol and diesel cars are made those in use will get older and as happens with older cars will slowly disappear off the roads. Those that do solider on will be so insignificant in number it won't matter.  Enthusiasts who might still drive such a car are actually a pretty tiny proportion of overall road users.  It will be what the masses choose to drive that will be important.  I would imagine what will ultimately limit the use of petrol and diesel cars is there being no where to fill up.

"This is all looking promising. However talk to any manufacturer and ask them about the battery lifetime. 

There will be dozens of batteries which fail in the next 10 years of EV driving. While you can repair any damage on a petrol engine with minor resources / CO2 emmision you cant repair a worn out batterie and you will need a new one. This will increase your footprint by about 90% . 

Secondly not only the CO2 is important in my opinion. If you compare the mining of the batterie materials compared to the standard petrol engine materials, the battery production is far more dirty. 

And the recycling of the batterie is worse too. 

When they are new, the EV cars are phenomenal tbh. I really dig the Taycan and Tesla Model S even the Honda E! However I´m a huge fan of used, old cars too because of the non existent and therefore not failing electronic parts.

Petro-Canada forces me to swipe like 3 cards before I can get gas (5 cents / L savings card, petro points card, credit card) and they're so slow. The cards should all have NFC chips in them (like the credit card) so I just tap the cards in sequence. The goal is to get pumping gas within 15 seconds or less.

Get rid of the stations that are facing outwards and force you to pre-pay for gas before pumping. They're the ones most exposed to the elements, and you have to run inside and go through the hassle of pre-paying.

Car washes without the rail that you have to position your wheel into, I hate those so much and will avoid washes that have them. Maybe a two-bay car wash so you don't have a huge lineup of cars waiting to get in. Also provide a way for cars to leave the queue, without allowing queue jumpers to get in.

"For a given displacement and manifold pressure, a diesel produces less torque than a petrol engine.

This is mostly due to the diesel engine not being able to combust all the air it takes in while a conventional petrol engine combusts all the air it takes in all the time.

Of course this also has drawbacks for the petrol engine, such as higher pumping losses at part throttle operation, as it has to work against a vacuum.

The diesel engine never works against a vaccum, it just injects less fuel to archive part throttle operation, making it more economical there.

And as part throttle operation is the most important for fuel consumption, diesels often rival (or even beat) hybrids there.","<div class=""md""><p>For a given displacement and manifold pressure, a diesel produces less torque than a petrol engine.</p>

**What's happening with internal combustion engines?**  
One thing is clear to us: We need the ultra-modern internal combustion engine for a few more years to effectively reduce CO2 emissions in the passenger car sector globally. That's why we're working on a new generation of engines: gasoline, diesel, six-cylinder, eight-cylinder. These will then also be technologically equipped for the coming emissions standards. In the six-cylinder engine alone, we are reducing CO2 emissions more massively than ever before in a new generation. We are helped in this by the fact that legislation in this area is beginning to converge worldwide. To reconcile emissions requirements on the one hand and performance demands on the other, we looked at the entire charge change and found a promising approach there. This technology then runs through all engine families and is supplemented by a high-performance e-drive pulley.  
**So from scratch - or rather a major overhaul?**  
Nothing is really the same as it was before. There's something completely new in the cylinder head. And with it, we're going to go one better in terms of efficiency. Because regardless of whether it's a combustion engine or an electric vehicle, reducing CO2 emissions across the board is crucial in the fight against climate change.

City driving doesn't really matter much when it comes to petrol vs diesel, from what I have found. I use about the same amount. I'm talking 2-3mpg difference. However, highway driving is where diesels really shine. If your commute is based on a lot of highways/freeways/autobahn, it very well will be worth it.

I also found that diesel engine repairs are ludicrously expensive compared to gasoline engines.

"Please keep in mind most of the answers in this thread are people who don't own them, and haven't joined the cult (yet).

Yes, watercooled engines make more power.  Yes, they are more reliable, and pretty much better in most metrics.

However, there are a few ADVANTAGES to the aircooled engine.

1. Sound.  Without a jacket of water and thick metal around each cylinder, instead each cylinder is just a metal jug with cooling fins, like a motorcycle.   This gives it a sound that isn't like watercooled engines.
2. Also for any flat engine, VWs and Porsche engines have a low CG, which makes for a very responsive car.  Yes, you can have responsive cars with watercooled cars, but keep in mind the context in which these cars were made, majority of America was driving 4500lb luxo barges that floated over curbs and small children.
3. They are very complicated, yet simple at the same time.  Working on them makes me feel more like a watch maker than a hot rodder.  Lots of little fasteners, each in their own spot, wave washers here, flat washers there, it's hard to keep track of everything... but once you work on one, you start to appreciate the simplicity, the reuse of parts on each cylinder, etc.
4. Dry Sump.   Because there's no oil pan on a 911 engine, they all have oil tanks which means they can do long, sustained high G turns, pretty much indefinitely.  Doing this in other cars might cause oil starvation/crank damage
5. Less weight.  No radiator filled with coolant.  No coolant system.   Just removes more weight, more weight is more fun.
6. In you instagram posts, you can write hashtag aircooled for mad scene points.

Basically.. .they're weird.  They're not as efficient or as powerful, but they're 'different', and once you become a bit more comfortable in how different they are, you sort of appreciate them just for being a bit odd.

Also....  specs arent' everything.   Gotta stress this.  A car can have better metrics but it won't necessarily be more fun.  My old mini cooper had less than 40hp and was probably the most fun car I've ever owned.   Old 911s and beetles are sort of the same thing; they aren't crazy fast, but they are 'fun'.   It's a combination of not much mass, low CG, good visibility, it provides a feel you cannot get today.  A lot of today's cars have a TON of grip and power, but they aren't as playful/lively imho.  They're just SRS BZNS all the time.  There's a certain...  thing... that isn't captured in performance tests.","<div class=""md""><p>Please keep in mind most of the answers in this thread are people who don&#39;t own them, and haven&#39;t joined the cult (yet).</p>

"It’s because an air-cooled engine, especially one that can pump out 600 hp like Porsche’s 3.6L turbocharged boxer, is nothing short of an engineering achievement.

To put this into perspective for you, a gas engine wastes 2/3s of its total output into heat rejection thru the cooling system and exhaust. This means, that in a 600 hp air-cooled Porsche engine (which actually makes 1800 hp, the figure you see is actually the useable hp), you need to deal with 1200 hp of heat produced. To give you an idea of how much heat that is, the cabin heater in your car only produces about 10-13 hp of heat at full blast. To reject 600 hp of heat (another 600 hp going into the exhaust) with an air-cooled design while simultaneously eliminating failure points like a radiator and hoses (which can leak), and a thermostat (which can get stuck), and a water pump (which can seize or leak) is no easy task.","<div class=""md""><p>It’s because an air-cooled engine, especially one that can pump out 600 hp like Porsche’s 3.6L turbocharged boxer, is nothing short of an engineering achievement.</p>

" This is my opinion. 

Truthfully, even though I live in the  US, this both saddens and angers me. Not only because I'm a car  enthusiast, but mainly because I feel like there are better alternatives  than just banning all gasoline/diesel cars. Also, the UK aren't the  first to do this. Other countries like Denmark and France are pushing to  ban all gas cars within as soon as 10-20 years. Even Los Angeles is  planning to ban all gas/diesel cars within city limits by 2025.

As  great as it is to hear that electric car manufacturers like Tesla and  Rivian are striving to create an electric car for the masses, the  biggest flaw with electric cars right now is where they get their power:  lithium batteries. They're inefficient, don't hold that much power,  don't last very long, and can create  fires or even explode when they  overheat. Plus, thinking about with all the nickel mining required to  produce lithium batteries, they're not really that great for the  environment either. Now, I've heard that some big tech companies like  Panasonic are trying to find an alternative and safer source for a  battery - that being solid-state batteries (link - [https://www.autonews.com/shift/solid-state-batteries-show-promise](https://www.autonews.com/shift/solid-state-batteries-show-promise)), and I'm sure with how technology is rapidly evolving, it won't be that long before we can implement that into electric cars.

I  wanna mention that I don't hate electric cars. I have massive respect  for Tesla and their cars such as the P100D and etc. However, with all of  that said, I think honestly governments are moving too fast in trying  to enforce the ""zero emissions"" and ""electric-only"" mindset for cars.  Instead, I feel like the better solution would be maybe trying to find a  viable bio-fuel, and I'm surprised that companies haven't really tried  to find this alternative. As crazy as it sounds, I've heard hemp  (cannabis) as a possible viable biofuel (Link - [https://hempgazette.com/industrial-hemp/biofuel-hemp-energy/](https://hempgazette.com/industrial-hemp/biofuel-hemp-energy/))  - Yes, that's right... Weed being used as a fuel source for cars. I'm  not saying that it would completely save gas and diesel cars from  becoming extinct, but I'm sure it would help. Though, I know that there  are a lot of drawbacks with creating a biofuel as well, but I feel like  that would be a better step in the right direction with trying to make  people stray away from using fossil fuels.","<div class=""md""><p>This is my opinion. </p>

The PD engine has a design flaw in the oil pump that will kill the engine (google 2.0TDI oil pump balance shaft for passat/a4/a6). The newer and much smoother CR engine is very reliable. The PD also has injector issues with the Passat. Do not buy a car with that old PD engine. PM me for any more details. I'm in NI too.
Most posts here are just giving generic diesel v petrol responses. I recommend finding a UK/Ireland Passat B6 Facebook group and make a post asking for guidance on the two engines.","<div class=""md""><p>So I actually have specific knowledge of these cars.

"Currently dailying a 07 Passat 2.0T Haven't driven the diesel version so I don't know how they drive. There's actually two different FSI engines, one of which is turbocharged, the other naturally aspired.

So let's look at the diesel vs petrol difference:

Petrol:

 *  Faster
 *  Less polutants (taxes might be lower)
 *  Gas price typically cheaper

Diesel:

 *  Better fuel ecconomy
 *  Longer lasting and potentially more reliable engine
 *  More torque

Now that's just the basic ideas. There's plenty of articles on this subject that go way more in depth if you wish to read them.

Now looking at the pure numbers, the NA FSI produces 148 HP and 148 lbs•ft of torque, whereas the TDI produces 138 HP and 236 lbs•ft of torque. Just looking at this, the TDI might actually be the same as the FSI in terms of acceleration. Though if you've got the turbocharged FSI, which has 197 HP and 207 lbs•ft of torque, the FSI would be faster.

Honestly, the big difference is what do you want from the car? Do you want to go fast? Then you'd be better off with petrol, though the difference is less obvious in smaller engines. Do you want better fuel economy? Then diesel is right for you.","<div class=""md""><p>Currently dailying a 07 Passat 2.0T Haven&#39;t driven the diesel version so I don&#39;t know how they drive.

"Every country that makes cars, makes them to what they jave viewed and experienced as a great solution for the issues they face. 

Example: USA has many states united into one large continuous country (geographically speaking) with very long highways and interstates connecting them. So on long drives that can extend for days, tou will want something that is able to take the abuse with minor issues and still want something extra incase you need to accelerate for whatever reason (like dodging an 18 wheeler trying to crash into you). 

When taking acceleration capability, load bearing capacity, vehicle speed on the highway, engine RPM, piston speed into account, you can see Why those engines are so big. Gas prices are a bit lower in the US compared to other countries. This with the fact that crossing those highways there's always a vas station within reach is the reason fuel consumption isn't really a huge priority. 

Another example:

Japan is 2502% smaller than the USA. Yes there are highways but there's also heavy city traffic with less space to go. Also public transportation is well sorted in Japan. So you wouldn't necessarily need a large engine because the likelihood of you going on an extended road trip with you car is small. Also most people in Japan do not own large properties. So a smaller car is more convenient (don't get me started on the tax). Most people even use bikes to get around. Also, because Japan has adopted the small engine mentality into their society, even tuners have grown to almost standardize turbo charging as the go to performance upgrade. Those who love V8 will get a full American muscle car vs a swap. 

In Europe you have a mix of both. This due to the fact that Europe has different countries. Public transportation is great and not so great at the same time depending where you live. Also there are varying tax laws and fuel prices depending where you go. So there are mixes of both large and small engines. 

In the Middle East, fuel costs are not that important, however power is. Climbing sand dunes is no joke. So when you see things like funny car tire sized turbo chargers hanging off of a Stroked TB48DE or VK56, Assume that is the norm there. 

Basically what I'm trying to say is that no particular way is better than the other. Every application has its purpose. The only real way to be the best is to pick some tricks from every section and try to make the best of it. That's where car enthusiast come in. 

That's also why the Supra is so loved. It may not have come from the factory with alot of power but it is an excellent blank canvas to build upon. Engine size is not to big or small. Engine can handle alot of boost if you decide to go that route or it can be a response monster if you decide to go that route. And beat of all it can package alot of power mods under it's hood/bonnet. 

For comparison, you can fit a 2k HP capable set up under the hood of a Supra. Be it a JZ or UZ engine. 

But you can't fit a turbo UZ under an IS300 hood for comparison. Eveb some muscle cars have problems keeping blowers under the stock hood. Remember the F&F charger?

But all these cars are great. Don't hate anyone of them. Just experience and love them all. A high response N/A V8/V10/V12 is a vlast to throw around because power is instantly available but a turbo charged 4 kr 6 cylinder is liek a NASA rocket ship once tou build thw RPMs, the longer you commit to the throttle, the faster you go and the more kt screams for more.","<div class=""md""><p>Every country that makes cars, makes them to what they jave viewed and experienced as a great solution for the issues they face. </p>

So on long drives that can extend for days, tou will want something that is able to take the abuse with minor issues and still want something extra incase you need to accelerate for whatever reason (like dodging an 18 wheeler trying to crash into you). </p>

<p>When taking acceleration capability, load bearing capacity, vehicle speed on the highway, engine RPM, piston speed into account, you can see Why those engines are so big. Gas prices are a bit lower in the US compared to other countries. This with the fact that crossing those highways there&#39;s always a vas station within reach is the reason fuel consumption isn&#39;t really a huge priority. </p>

<p>Another example:</p>

<p>Japan is 2502% smaller than the USA. Yes there are highways but there&#39;s also heavy city traffic with less space to go. Also public transportation is well sorted in Japan. So you wouldn&#39;t necessarily need a large engine because the likelihood of you going on an extended road trip with you car is small. Also most people in Japan do not own large properties. So a smaller car is more convenient (don&#39;t get me started on the tax). Most people even use bikes to get around. Also, because Japan has adopted the small engine mentality into their society, even tuners have grown to almost standardize turbo charging as the go to performance upgrade. Those who love V8 will get a full American muscle car vs a swap. </p>

<p>In Europe you have a mix of both. This due to the fact that Europe has different countries. Public transportation is great and not so great at the same time depending where you live. Also there are varying tax laws and fuel prices depending where you go. So there are mixes of both large and small engines. </p>

<p>In the Middle East, fuel costs are not that important, however power is. Climbing sand dunes is no joke. So when you see things like funny car tire sized turbo chargers hanging off of a Stroked TB48DE or VK56, Assume that is the norm there. </p>

<p>Basically what I&#39;m trying to say is that no particular way is better than the other. Every application has its purpose. The only real way to be the best is to pick some tricks from every section and try to make the best of it. That&#39;s where car enthusiast come in. </p>

<p>That&#39;s also why the Supra is so loved. It may not have come from the factory with alot of power but it is an excellent blank canvas to build upon. Engine size is not to big or small. Engine can handle alot of boost if you decide to go that route or it can be a response monster if you decide to go that route. And beat of all it can package alot of power mods under it&#39;s hood/bonnet. </p>

<p>For comparison, you can fit a 2k HP capable set up under the hood of a Supra. Be it a JZ or UZ engine. </p>

<p>But you can&#39;t fit a turbo UZ under an IS300 hood for comparison. Eveb some muscle cars have problems keeping blowers under the stock hood. Remember the F&amp;F charger?</p>

<p>But all these cars are great. Don&#39;t hate anyone of them. Just experience and love them all.

"Ironically, the engine itself is not all that big - the pushrod valvetrain works well at low RPM's, and takes up a lot less space than overhead cams.

American cars have big displacement because:

* Fuel consumption and power are approximately the product of displacement X RPM.  A 3.0L motor at 2000 RPM will have roughly the same output and fuel consumption as a 1.5L motor at 4000 (all other things being equal...which they never are)
* We don't have any tax or regulatory regime based around engine displacement - we tax fuel and have regulations and fees based on GVWR.
* It's cheaper to bore out cylinders than it is to make an engine rev faster and/or work better at high revs.  Pushrod valvetrains are much cheaper, smaller, and lighter than overhead cams and the associated drive system.

<p>Holden/GM and the other Amercican car makers yelled enough about bigger is better for long enough that people don&#39;t know what is actually a good car anymore, they just repeat the same crap that they hear v=everyday and go buy the car without ever thinking for themselves and trying out different brands.</p>

On a serious note these kind of tests are just fucking stupid, top tier internet content. People look different thinks in cars. If you really want to be a smart car owner you buy whatever is cheapest sell price/mileage/repair costs. Nobody needs a cup holder, nobody should need a fucking rear-view camera or automatic parking. Nobody needs more than \~100bhp unless you drive a lot and need to get past the truck safely on a normal, one lane per side road.

I have fun every time I drive my car. I'm willing to pay a little bit extra for that as you use it pretty much every day. It's like paying extra for very comfortable shoes, which are impossible or expensive to maintain. Not a smart choise financially but man it's nice to walk when your feet doesn't hurt or get wet in the rain.

It's sad that some poeple buy a car as a status symbol. It's also sad that if you want a newish RWD car (which is IMO more fun and more safe if you train how to handle it vs. FWD) you basically have two choises in EU: BMW or Mercedes.

"Grew up driving through rural developing country so very familiar with your driving situation, and the dreaded oncoming lane overtake (had more than my share of close calls). 

Would suggest you start implementing the one headlight rule - always keep one headlight peaking out in the oncoming lane, ducking back in when needed (obv when you see oncoming traffic). This will get you used to timing oncoming traffic and how long of a gap you might have to overtake. After you get a feel for the timing, gain speed in the same lane (while peeking) and then cross to oncoming lane once you’re already at a good speed (maintaining acceleration throughout the overtake). 

This would reduce your chances of getting stuck in a troublesome situation, and you would still have the option of gearing down and gunning it if needed. 

Obviously this is still a risky way of driving, but a technique most people who drive in such situations try to master. Safe travels!

"I'm glad to hear the the RAV4 kept you safe; my view is that power can be a safety feature at times.

The 2GR powered RAV4 is a gem, it can hold a good amount of stuff, the 4wd system works well I'm Chicago winters, it's decent on gas and absurdly reliable and as mentioned, it can hustle. People miss that the curb weight is very reasonable: just under 3700Lbs in top trim with the V6 and 4WD.

My Dad bought one new in 2009 and he has called it his favorite car ever. My family is dismayed that Toyota discontinued the V6 in newer generations, the base 4 cylinder is weak in comparison.

My Mom would have bought a V6 RAV4 in 2015 when she was due for a car, but as they were unavailable she jumped to Subaru and bought a Forester XT (the WRX motor in the Forester is fun).

"We have owned Toyotas since I got out of college.  Bought a new '74 Celica GT (vs my other choices - Chevy Vega or Ford Pinto) and never looked back.  Had two Celica's, Sienna van, a 4 runner, Scion TC, Prius and three RAV4s, with the latest being being a 2021 Hybrid.  Love the brand as they make solid reliable transportation.  For the fun side I've owned ten Bimmers since 1977, from a '74 2002tii through multiple 3 series, a 7 series and Emma my restored 1987 M6.  Never really had any issues with any of them either and great to drive.

Diesel engines have to run for a bit to achieve their optimal operating temperature, at which they are very efficient. This is why in city driving, with many short trips, diesel engines aren't that much more efficient than petrols.

Hybrids tend to have the ICE ""kick in"" occasionally, meaning it doesn't run all the time. If it were a diesel, which takes longer to heat up, it may never even reach its target temperature. This would also be terrible for the DPF, as it would have to regenerate very often.

Really it&#39;s a mess and I don&#39;t think there&#39;s much of a future for it, despite the delicious low end torque.</p>

"Because first of all diesels aren't more efficient, the perceived higher efficiency comes from the fact that diesel has a higher energy density but overall the thermal efficiency isn't really any better.

Beside this the best hybrid systems are the ones that use a naturally aspirated engine that delivers consistent power and is very reliable.

Diesel engines need a turbo to deliver any meaningful power which means the hybrid can't just let the engine run at 1000rpm because there would be no power until you have enough rpm to spool up the turbo.

The third factor is that diesel engines are dirty as fuck and need a complex emissions cleaning system that needs a lot of heat to function so there would be a lot of smoke coming out of the exhaust until your engine is finally hot.

And of course you would need vastly different gear ratios for the diesel as the max rpm are so low.","<div class=""md""><p>Because first of all diesels aren&#39;t more efficient, the perceived higher efficiency comes from the fact that diesel has a higher energy density but overall the thermal efficiency isn&#39;t really any better.</p>

"In the US very few pickups are diesels. These tend to be large capacity trucks used for towing and/or with big campers on the back.

US emissions laws essentially ban diesel engines for anything below a certain weight of vehicle. 

Of course, the US is a big market, especially for new things. So this undoubtedly factors into carmakers' decisions about what designs to move forward with. 

I once had a long conversation with an older engineer who was wealthy from money he made from selling his patents and company to a bigger semiconductor multinational. He sounded credible. 

His opinion was that you could get really good efficiency from a small diesel running a generator, at a constant RPM at the efficiency peak for the motor, and then just running the car as an EV from a small bank of batteries.

"The emission systems are getting to a point where they are fairly reliable. Much more so than they used to be. GM is offering a smaller diesel on a few more of their models than just 3/4 tons and up. And I'm seeing quite a few of them now. Not likely but if people start buying these models it's possible they will consider a diesel hybrid.

As other said reliability is still an issue with after treatment systems but I can say pretty confidently it's more so the cost of the components/repairs and less the dependability of them that owners have an issue with.

I got a quote from Mopar on a oem DOC for a 2007 ram. My cost was 7500 bucks for just the part. If the EPA wants people to stop deleting the emissions they need to work with the manufacturers on lowering the cost of maintenance on said systems. Sure you can find it cheaper aftermarket but it's still going to be expensive.

Having to tell people they have to spend 5-20k on their exhaust irks me. I don't delete them because it's illegal but I understand why people want to do it.

Honestly if a manufacturer could build a diesel hybrid power train without needind the after treatment systems to meet emissions requirements, id bed it would sell better than EVs here in the USA. And manufacturers nor their investors would ever let that happen just solely on the large amount of money they have put in EV technology.

"Trains are diesel electric.  As are giant mining haul trucks.

Part of diesel's efficiency is there's just more power per volume in diesel than gasoline.  In the US that relative energy density is reflected in the price.   In Europe, the diesel is cheaper, but that would be maybe about politics, or supply and demand.   US got a bad taste of diesel in the malaise era, the US fuel pricing puts diesel on par with gas,  and the US drives the market.  Say otherwise and we'll bomb the snot out of you.

I remember the malaise diesels.     They were notorious for being loud, difficult to start in the cold, and rather large heavy for the amount of power they put out.  I know the Europeans refined them a lot better since, but the LA smog sort of put a kabash on it.   The particulate issue is maybe not quite solved.

""Hybrids"" as we got them in the Prius and Insight needed the engine to start right now, with a minimum of fuss to be handled by robots.     If it's -40, and you need the glow plugs for a minute first, that's not going to work as well on the fly when you need the thing to start like a golf cart.

Toyota went with the Aitkson cycle in the Prius which is a more efficient diesel like engine than the Otto, in that it powers up slower and less energy dense but more efficient, so somewhat like the Diesel cycle.      

It's kind of a shame we got series hybrid and not parallel.    Parallel might have lent itself better to diesel, like a train, but with a battery.    The output of the engine though got tied to the wheels, to get that extra power, and that might have been more efficient yet, so maybe not all bad.   

The motors in the early hybrids and many hybrids still are too wimpy, really just braking energy recapture, instead of being primary movers.   That might have been from the early Ni-Cd batteries they were using not being as dense as today's lithium ions.   100lbs of Ni-Cd might not have had been able to put out the amperage to be a primary mover.  The lithium RC cars I've played with recently are a league apart from the Ni-Cd cars I raced as a kid.  

From that, the ""Synergy"" drive became the  de-facto standard, and the hybrids we got were rather mild and series, and between those two things, gas worked better.  

In the future, I'd like to see parallel, and even diesel become more of a thing.  A diesel generator charging the battery while you drive, with that diesel tuned to just generate at a constant rate, something diesels like to do, run at a constant speed and load.    The BMW i3 is a good example of this, but of course uses gas.    With the particulate issues, maybe that's not a bad thing.   

As we get transition to pure electric cars from gas, we're still going to need the diesel for trains,  big trucks, some ships, useful things like that.    If a barrel of crude gives a fixed percentage of gas and diesel, might be better to use the gas where we can, in the cars.  Could be diesel from market condition gets more expensive from a supply and demand perspective, as gas production goes down.  Could be why diesel is more expensive in the US the distances are larger, so there's more need for trains and trucks to go vast distances, more demand for same supply makes a higher price.","<div class=""md""><p>Trains are diesel electric.

"Gasoline engines are not substantially less efficient than diesel if held at the right operating point and the overall cost to build, run, and maintain such a gasoline engine is dramatically less than a comparable diesel engine. Look at a Toyota 2ZR-FXE 1.8L I4 gas hybrid engine. It is port injected, only intake side VVT-iW. It is a remarkably simple and straightforward engine. The only exhaust aftertreatment system is a standard three-way catalytic converter. There is only a single cooled EGR port.

A comparable diesel engine like the VW EA288 has two cooled EGR circuits, ultra high pressure common rail direct injection, turbocharger, 2 stage oil pump, VVT, and on top of all of this complexity it also has a tremendously expensive SCR system to treat NOx, a DPF to handle the high PM emissions from diesel engines, and a close-coupled catalyst to burn off residual fuel and carbon monoxide.

If you purely go by peak efficiency a 2ZR-FXE is something like 40% thermal efficiency. An EA288 is probably around 45%. So ~12% better efficiency but in practice it will be far less because of DPF active regeneration. On top of this you will have to deal with all of the issues that come with a diesel engine like keeping the DEF topped off, DPF clogging if you don't drive long highway trips, intake manifold clogging from EGR and no fuel wash effect unlike a port injected gasoline engine, and incredibly expensive fuel system parts because it has to work at 28,000 PSI unlike port injection system which is closer to 43 to 58 psi.

Hybrids are also already more expensive than conventional drivetrains because of all the high voltage electronics and batteries. And conveniently almost all hybrid systems are designed around operating gasoline engines where they are most efficient. The primary advantage of diesel engines is how they have a wide range of efficient operation because they do not use a throttle and operate in the lean burn regime. So you've added all this cost and complexity for capabilities that a hybrid drivetrain won't really use.","<div class=""md""><p>Gasoline engines are not substantially less efficient than diesel if held at the right operating point and the overall cost to build, run, and maintain such a gasoline engine is dramatically less than a comparable diesel engine.

"Mostly stated well throughout the thread but the substance of the reason is that while there is nothing technically demanding or regulatory issue preventing diesel vehicles from using hybrid drivetrains, however few automakers have gone this directiong because diesel engines and hybrid transmissions don't play to eachothers strengths all that well. The end benefits would be comparatively marginal compared to the costs. 

A modern eCVT hybrid vehicle will give most of the benefits of a parrellel and series hybrid systems and will mostly allow the engine to run when it is needed at peak of its efficency band and turn the engine off at all other times. A gas/petrol hybrid takes further advantage of this by using a low strung atkinson cycle motor which sacrifices HP per liter for a cooler more efficient engine where power spikes are handled by the electric motor. You can do the same thing in a diesel, but the efficiency band is larger in the first place meaning getting perfect is less important, and the warm up phase which is already already substantial issue on current hybrids will prevent the engine from turning off when not needed, and once the battery is full all that energy is wasted which makes shorter trips less efficient especially in colder weather. With a diesel hybrid you end up with a car that good on the highway and decent if not perfect in the city, this ends up being pretty much a regular diesel + regen braking so not all that exciting there.

A different but related issue means hybrid cars also rarely have turbos, it messes quite a bit with the decision on when to turn off the engine while it is a solvable problem most carmakers havent made it a priority.","<div class=""md""><p>Mostly stated well throughout the thread but the substance of the reason is that while there is nothing technically demanding or regulatory issue preventing diesel vehicles from using hybrid drivetrains, however few automakers have gone this directiong because diesel engines and hybrid transmissions don&#39;t play to eachothers strengths all that well.

Hybrids like the Prius were actually a bigger deal in the US, especially in the 2000's decade and never took over Europe the same way. 

In the US the toyota prius took off in its first decade because it was an efficient larger car which appealed to the sensibilities of the time and filled a void in the US car market. In Europe the prius was just as efficient, but this void was much smaller, there were many efficient smaller cars and diesels which did not exist in the US market competing for the same price conscious consumers as the new hybrid. Additionally, the efficiency gained by the prius also came as much from its electric motors as it did from it's atkinson cycle engine which sacrificed compression ratio and HP/l for better mileage, a disaster in the European market which taxes cars by engine displacement unlike the US and it's gargantuan 2.0 liter displacement did it no favors.

So for about a decade hybrid market development leaned North American at the same time North Americans hated diesels for passenger vehicles. Other factors were at play but there already 482 other comments and I am sure you are tired of reading about it already.

"They aren't the same engines. They are two engines that are completely unrelated to each other and just happen to both have around 2.0 l displacement.

More torque translates into a car that feels more powerful and will get away quicker. If you're accelerating from 50 km/h to 100 km/h and you already are in a relatively high gear, this is where you can really see the difference between a car with lots of torque and very little torque.

Neither of the engine options you mentioned is particularily slow, either. 258 PS and 370 Nm already is plenty in a C-Class, I'm sure that you won't reach a point in every day driving where you'd say that it could use a little more power.

"I see ""petrol"" but I am speaking to the US market. 10-15 years ago I'd have said diesel.

Now, gas.

Reasons:

* The increased emissions hardware is undeniably the weak link in diesel reliabilty these days. Often won't leave you stranded, but I've had an annoying ""clean exhaust filter"" message pop up on my truck a couple times. 

* Complexity - I can do much more work on a gas engine myself compared to a diesel engine, and typically a gas engine bay is just a more pleasant place to work. Large turbo/intercooler piping, bigass fuel filter assembly under the hood, etc.

* The delta in MPG has steadily decreased, undercutting the primary advantage of diesel for most people.

* The delta between gas and diesel prices has steadily increased in my area. Diesel is now about 10% more than 93 octane. So while most people have tunnel vision on MPG, the actual miles per dollar is much closer, sometimes the gas engine can win out (platform dependent obviously).

* Transmissions - the latest transmissions with their very wide gear spread negate some of the torque advantage of a diesel.

The only clear advantage diesel still has for me is range. I often have to do 600ish miles in a day and idle at a very rural job site. I love my diesel truck and it was absolutely superior to any gas powerplants that were offered at the time, but times change and my next truck will almost certainly be gas.

"The engines operate differently, and the fuels are different. Standard pump Petrol can handle a maximum compression ratio of 13:1. (Better fuels or better combustion chamber design will raise that a bit). Diesel can handle 17-20:1. 
Petrol engines suck petrol and air into the cylinder, compress it, then at the right moment ignite the charge using a spark plug. Timing is critical so that the pressure rise pushes the piston down AFTER TDC. Octane rating of the fuel is the resistance to compression ignition. Higher octane rating means the fuel can handle higher compression before detonating (spontaneous ignition). When petrol burns, it has a rapid flame front from the spark plug.

"It's recently being done via HCCI and Mazda Skyactiv-X.  These engines do not use a spark plug.  Prior to ~10-years ago, direct injection was a rarity and it's a necessarily technology for running a petrol engine without spark.  

In the petrol engine, the spark timing is different than the engine timing, eg. the spark is 'advanced' relative to the RPM's of the engine to create a proper combustion event that puts the bulk of the expansion energy into pushing the piston.  Because of the time for the combustion to occur, the initiation event needs to occur before the piston reaches TDC.  If you initiate too early you will create too high of pressures in the cylinder.  If too late, you will not get adequate power and economy.  So there is an optimal point based on the flame front propagation of petrol.

Diesel engines have always directly injected the fuel into the chamber and this allows for direct mixing.  Diesel fuel wants to have a high 'centane' rating, which is the auto-ignition property.  Conversely on petrol engines we want a high octane number for resistance to knock.  Diesel engines do not even inject fuel until almost TDC at which point the compression of air has heated it enough to cause autoignition of the fuel.  This cannot normally be done on a petrol engine because it will cause pre-ignition and damage the engine.","<div class=""md""><p>It&#39;s recently being done via HCCI and Mazda Skyactiv-X.

Sauce: engine machinist for many years","<div class=""md""><p>Most dedicated CNG/LPG engines will be equipped with harder valve seats and sometimes sodium filled or stellite faced exhaust valves because there is no lubrication or cooling on the valves like there would be in a gas engine which causes the valves and seats to run hotter than usual. </p>

<p>For example, many 4.6 Ford engines were deployed as dedicated CNG fueled and SBI actually calls for a different valve seat material in the CNG engines than the gas engines. </p>

Even if several governments decided to ban all gas cars, there simply isn&#39;t enough resource and production capacity in the world to provide the batteries for that many EVs. On top of that right now EVs are almost all sold at a loss, even at their elevated price points vs gas cars. If you forced manufacturers to go fully electric (ignoring the battery supply problem for now) you&#39;d have the choice of either supporting them with government subsidies (i.e. your tax money) or having the new car market implode because nobody could afford them when sold at a profit.</p>

"Random guesses here:

I’d say by 2030, electric cars will probably outsell new gas cars. 

Roughly at the same time, subscription self driving car services will really start to take off - like 10-15% of the market will be people foregoing buying a car. 

2040ish, gas cars will start to become the toy of the rich. As the gas infrastructure falls apart, gas will lose economies of scale and get a lot more expensive.  Further pushing people into electric.  Self driving cars are at 40% and the first self driving only lanes start appearing on major thoroughfares.

"In 50 years, internal combustion cars will probably be obsolete/collector cars.  Electric cars will be out-performing ic in every way.

Having said that, I wouldn't necessarily jump on the electric bandwagon NOW - though a Porsche Taycan sounds tasty - but it's still early days for electric.  50 years is a long ways off.

Fossil fuels aren't unlimited, though they seem that way.  Electric motors continue to improve, as do batteries - internal combustion has pretty much reached near its peak and further improvements have diminishing returns.  Waste heat is a huge efficiency killer that even mazda's compression ignition, or Nissan's variable compression motors don't deal with.

Regenerative braking is essential to high efficiency.

Very much so. Sustained power will be a function of cooling, whether that involves better cooling systems or beefier components that don't melt with high current. Peak power will be a function of your battery. Motors, apart from cooling, are mostly irrelevant.

That extra complexity cost money, making turbo variants much more expensive than N/A version.  It can be hard to justify the cost of a turbo 4 cyl when you can have a N/A v6 making close to the same power and torque.

"This is the second wave of turbo gasoline engines.  In the mid 70s - late 80s there were a bunch of small turbo engines powering great euro cars like the 911 turbo, saab 900, various volvos, and tons of others.  Since many countries had car taxes based on engine displacement and strapping on a turbo to make a sporty model was cheaper than developing a whole new engine it made sense to use them.  Eventually more complex ECUs and other improvements made the cost, complexity and maintenance of a turbo mostly unnecessary to get good power.  Porsche stuck with the formula, but turbos went away for a while.  

Tighter fuel economy standards have changed the math and made the expense of turbos make sense again.  But if you drive around on boost all the time you're not really going to see great consumption numbers.  The EPA tests are pretty light on the throttle.

> The advantages of turbo include more low rpm power

That's a very recent development.  Older turbo engines have horrific turbo lag and pretty much no power off boost.

"No you need to have this towed to a shop. Do not start the engine. 

Gasoline doesn't lubricate like diesel. The high pressure fuel pump will destroy itself, it it hasn't already, if you run this. The fuel system needs to be completely drained out at minimum. If you are lucky. But you are probably looking at a 4-figure repair bill already. Gas in a modern Diesel is unfortunately usually very expensive.","<div class=""md""><p>No you need to have this towed to a shop. Do not start the engine. </p>

Look, I don't think anyone has an issue with an old, poorly maintained rustbucket being taken off the road, but compulsory retirement of all petrol cars older than 15 years old is going to result in a whole bunch of desirable, well maintained cars being sent to the scrapper.

For reference, 15 years is enough for the oldest of the 997 Porsche 911s to be caught up in this. Imagine being forced to scrap a 997 GT3 that's been maintained meticulously because the Government has just taken a regulatory sledgehammer to all cars.","<div class=""md""><p>This is horrible.</p>
