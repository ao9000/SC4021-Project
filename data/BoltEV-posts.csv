## ELI5 (EXPLAIN LIKE I'M FIVE)

You're going to effectively get a new battery. This will take time, so be patient. GM has finally stood up to LG and will do what they can to do right by all us owners. In the mean time, follow the instructions below to reduce your risk.  


## WHAT IS HAPPENING?

All 2017-2019 are going to get new replacement modules that will bring the battery capacity to 66kWh and range up to 259 miles EPA (8% increase to original range, same as 2020+).The priority will go to highest risk first - we're told early 2019s which do deep discharges. Then proceed based on risk level.

The 2020+ model years will get new replacement modules unless a process can be devised which will allow detection of faulty modules in the field. If this happens, then refurbished modules may be used to replace the defective modules in order to speed up the replacement cycle and reduce waste, and non-defective modules will be left. After you get the replacement, you will be back to full range (or upgraded range for 2017-2019), with no restrictions. Everyone will get a new 8-year 100k mile warranty effective date of service.

No modules are available yet as all have the potential problems. Until GM can ensure safe cells are produced and in vehicles, no replacements will be done and there is a stop sale on all Bolts of all years.

[Most recent details here](https://electrek.co/2021/08/20/gm-expands-bolt-recall-to-all-chevy-bolts-blames-supplier-lg/)  


## WHAT THE HECK IS A MODULE?

The battery contains 288 cells, split into 10 modules in 5 serviceable pairs called rows. GM's PR team is referring to the row as a module, so from their communications there are 5 modules in a Bolt battery. Using their parlance, four modules have 60 cells, and the fifth module (on top under the rear seat) has 48 cells.  


## WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN REPLACING ALL MODULES AND REPLACING THE BATTERY?

The battery contains a lot of electronics, wiring, relays, the battery computer, and the battery shell (which is a very strong structural member of the car). There are no problems with these components, so they do not need to be replaced. The net result is that you will have the core components of your battery - the actual cells - brand new. That's the important part.  


## WHY AREN'T THEY JUST REPLACING ALL BATTERIES?

For speed and cost. It's cheaper and way easier to ship modules, and the division of labor will allow quicker turnaround times by just replacing the modules in the field.  


## WHAT ARE THE DETAILS ON THE PROBLEM?

GM has found the manufacturing processes that can cause a torn anode (battery tab) and folded separators present in all LG lines that produced Bolt cells, in both South Korea and both plants in the United States. As a result all Bolts are potentially at risk. More details on this tomorrow.  


## HOW WILL GM ENSURE THAT THE NEW CELLS ARE SAFE?

They will be able to, I've spoken to them, more on this tomorrow.  


## HOW LONG WILL THIS TAKE?

We don't know exactly yet, but more on this tomorrow.  


## WHICH DEALERS WILL BE ABLE TO HANDLE THIS?

The module replacement is a relatively straight forward thing, and there are enough checks within the car and the process that it is safe for any EV certified technician to do. Any dealer that sells the Bolt must have at least one EV certified technician on staff. It's significantly easier than replacing an engine, for example. If you do not know which dealers have an EV certified technician you can call the concierge (see below).  


## WHAT CAN I DO TO REDUCE MY RISK?

If you can: reduce your charging limit to 90% (or hilltop reserve on 2017-2018), and do not run below about 30% state of charge. If you can't do this, then either get as close as you can or ask GM to provide a free loaner or rental (see below). Park outside away from anything flammable or that could be damaged by massive amounts of water.

Either way - use departure mode charging to only charge up before you leave. Do not leave the vehicle charging unattended. Avoid deep discharging - plug in as soon as you can. You can use OBD2 to check for cell voltages or to dive deep into your car's data if you want low level information. - [https://allev.info/boltpids/](https://allev.info/boltpids/)

You could also get a wireless interconnected smoke alarm that ties in with your house alarm, and put it in the rear seat of your Bolt. This may give you a few minutes extra notice.

You can also get a ""J1772 extension"" cable to give you more length to charge outdoors. Just search in Google or Amazon for that term.  


## WHAT IF I CAN'T DO FOLLOW THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS?

Do as much as you can. It will not impact your ability to have warranty or get your battery modules replaced. If you don't accept the risk, GM will provide you with a loaner or rental. See below.  


## SHOULD I CHARGE AT L1 OR DCFC OR REDUCED CURRENT?

No - the safest charging is Level 2 32A. This is closest to the ""sweet spot"" of charging speed for lithium ion. Slower than that or DCFC is less ideal. If these are your only choice, then you can use them.  


## WHAT DO I NEED TO DO NOW?

At the moment, follow the recommendations above. There is no known timeline yet for safe modules to be manufactured and thus available for replacements. There is no point in calling your dealer yet.

If you have a 2017-2019 and have not yet had the software update, get it done. This is for 2017-2019 only, 2022 already has this, 2020-2021 is not available yet. It adds an alarm that will go off if a fire is detected. This will give you several minutes more notice.  


## IS GM STILL DOING BUYBACKS AND/OR MSRP SWAPS?

They may still pursue buybacks depending on your local laws, however all MSRP swaps are stopped since there is a stop sale on all Bolts.  


## WHAT ARE THE DETAILS ON THE FIRES THAT HAVE OCCURRED?

[I maintain a list with all the publicly known details](https://electrek.co/2021/07/28/everything-we-know-about-the-chevy-bolt-ev-fires/). I have also interviewed many of the owners to have first-hand information on the situations.

# HOW DOES THE FIRE PROGRESS?

Each fire is different, but the battery first will produce copious amounts of smoke. This will last for at least 15 minutes possibly up to an hour before fire erupts. The most likely spot for fire to erupt is under the rear seat due to the metal shell of the battery and that's where a plastic fuse holder is located. Once fire erupts, the car will be engulfed within a few minutes if not drowned in water.  


# WHAT IF THAT'S UNACCEPTABLE?

You have several options available:

* If you are still concerned, or need help, contact GM's concierge line at 1-833-EVCHEVY.
* Other numbers: 1-800-333-0510 or 1-819-994-3328 to speak with a defect investigator.
* **You can be get a loaner vehicle or a rental car at GM's expense and they will store your Bolt - just call them.** 
* You can also request a buyback via the concierge line. This is also available to lessees.

&#x200B;

# WHAT CAN US CANUCKS DO?

* Call GM Canada at 1-800-263-3777 ou en Francais 1-800-263-7854.
* Alternate GM Canada customer care center at 1-800-GM-DRIVE (1 800 463-7483)

It’s an absurd amount of driving even in a Gas car. We are young and have driven gas cars (and a bicycle once) across the US numerous times. 

Several observations:

1. This trip was planned completely and utterly around charging stations. Charging stations dominated where we went and our schedule. However, when you’re driving this far in a short period of time, what else are you to do. We picked restaurants and parks and things to see and do within walking distance of chargers. 
2. It was fun and novel and even thrilling to  attempt to make it in this slow charging EV. It added to the trip greatly. That said, we are already a bit fed up and ready to sell this car (PM me, 2023 Bolt EV 1LT 22,000 miles. Pittsburgh area. Dog. Non smokers. Would detail dog hair) and upgrade to a faster charging car with a heat pump because as you can see we drive a lot. 
3. This would be utterly impossible in cold weather 
4. Had we done this in 12 or 13 days instead of 10 I think the amount of time we actually were sitting there waiting for the car to charge would have been around 0. With this trip length we did finally get into that mode on the last two days doing 1000 miles per day racing back home. But for the first 8 days we almost NEVER were waiting for the car to charge. More often than not we were like oh man the car is already charged plenty let’s get back. Having a dog and picking chargers with cool stuff nearby probably added to this. 
5. When it’s like 65-80 degrees the car likes to charge around 50-55kw
6. When it’s into the 80’s or near 90’s you’ll hear the fan in the front turn on and the battery coolant on the right side of the hood begins pumping. In this mode, we found popping the hood allows the heat to dissipate more and the charge rate increase. 
7. Many chargers will just give you 38-42kw for no apparent reason when they’re capable of much more
8. Getting a free full level 2 charge at a hotel each night on your road trip makes it so much better.

I asked what this was, since it wasn't online in their ad and they told me to look again, and it was now shown online. So sometime between my call Saturday and lunchtime today they added $5k to each bolt.  

I didn't even get in I just said, ""if this is non negotiable, then it's not worth wasting either of our time"". He said no, so then we walked back to the service center where they were appraising my car and I just went home.

BLUF: Battery will be replaced. Dealership has no estimated arrival time for the replacement battery.

The vehicle was towed to a local dealership and they disconnected the 12V battery. When the technician later evaluated the car, he determined a battery replacement would be the best solution. Additionally, GM sent out an engineer yesterday and the engineer also recommended replacing the battery.

As for the cause, I am waiting for more detailed information. It’s possible that this was caused by a battery cell issue.

Chevy automatically opts all Bolt owners into their ""Smart Driver"" service that tracks your driving behaviors (speeding, hard braking, hard acceleration, etc.). Per multiple users on the Bolt forums, this data is then sold to a data aggregator called LexisNexis, which then sells this information to insurance companies. Given that a majority of insurance providers use LexisNexis, it's a pretty safe bet that your insurance company would happily use this type of data to increase your premiums.

When I tried to figure out if my identity was stolen or something, I was able to get a huge report about myself.  Part of it was about every trip I've made in that car.  No location data, but date, time, distance, VIN, and events (Acceleration, Hard brake, and High speed).  Mind you, this was NOT from a GM-internal report, it was one of those companies that do credit reporting and the like.  So GM must be sharing this.  It took some fumbling around to figure it out, but here's how I was able to unenroll:

1. Log in to the myChevrolet app
2. Go to **More**
3. Tap **Chevrolet Smart Driver**
4. Here you can see all the stuff that's tracked *and shared*.  On top, there's a **Driving Activity** drop-down that doesn't immediately look like a drop-down.  Click that, and **Enrollment Settings**
5. Ignore the ""Program Overview"" thing that tries to justify it's creepy existence.  Well, I guess you can look if you want.  But be sure to tap **Unenroll**
6. Pick a reason (I chose **Other** because there is no ""this is creepy AF"" option) and click **Unenroll** again
7. Click **OK** at the pathetic notification that they'll miss tracking you
8.

They say that’s how everyone works. I know I should just pay at this point, but I am really thinking about walking away on principal! I will be complaining to GM about this. This is shitty behavior!

They have been careful to not put anything in writing.  I am starting to think I should have been recording all my calls!

I have never bought a new car before, always used cars since my few brushes with dealers have been so bad. Been looking at EUVs for about nine months on and off and had pretty much given up until Friday :(

<Edited to add>
Thank you all for the advice and support.  I am back home after this ordeal without the car.  They already have sold the car to someone else.  I still don't know what my payment was for, but it's non-refundable, and they are saying I refused to accept delivery of the car and sign the paperwork.

It turns out one of the initial calls was recorded since I called from an office phone and all our work phone calls are recorded (is this the only time big brother works in the little guys favor?)

I can't really say more at this point in time.  We will be sending them a letter by the end of the week.
