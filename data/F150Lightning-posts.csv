The website clearly showed my dealer’s selling price at MSRP with no after dealer markup. When I arrived at Sunrise on 7/30/22 to get my truck the Price Summary they gave me showed an additional $2780 for accessories that I didn’t order (LoJack, VIN etching or something).  They refused to remove these items or the extra charge. I asked if I could think about the new price for 24 hours and they said no. I asked if I could think about it for 12 hours and they said if I left that day without purchasing it they would sell it to someone else with a hefty markup. 

After more negotiating they said they would throw in certain add-ons for free (tinting, curb rash repair) as long as I agreed to leave a 5 star review after the sale. I didn’t agree to these terms but decided to proceed with the purchase with the extra $2780. 

I went to the financing manager where he then tried to placate me by saying he thought it was wrong for the dealer to tack on those features. I told him to not pretend that he was on my side because they could remove those charges and items if they wanted to. He then became very aggressive and got in my face saying that if I’m so upset I shouldn’t buy the truck. With consent from the Sales Manager, he refused to do the paperwork and I was told they would not be selling me the truck. 

Before leaving I told everyone there I was writing down their names and it would be in my review and letter to Ford corporate. The sales manager then said “you have my information but I have yours too. If I see my name in a review, something can happen”. When I asked if that was a threat, he said “take it anyway you want”. 

I’ve been a loyal Ford customer. My father bought his last truck from Sunrise and was planning on purchasing his next truck from them as well. I hope the $2800 hidden markup was worth losing two customers and tarnishing Ford’s reputation. Their behavior was utterly shameful.  

Direct to consumer can’t come soon enough. 

TLDR: The dealership was looking for any reason not to sell me the truck close to its MSRP so they could sell it to someone else at a premium.  They’re trash.

But between California’s fluctuating gas prices, and my wife’s desire to drive to multiple stores daily, I began looking into getting her an EV back in November, to compensate for the gas.  A few hours later she drove off smiling, with a brand new 2023 Lightning XLT (Avalanche color).  
Over the next month and a half we had traveled from CA to Vegas two times (visiting family), took a Disneyland trip, and traveled plenty of miles around town.
Over three thousand miles later, I realized my own beloved diesel was spending more and more time in the garage, while I was taking every opportunity to borrow the truck I had purchased for my wife.
This brought me to January 4th of this year.  While finally driving my diesel truck on a short trip, I happened to pass by my local Ford dealership, and noticed a beautiful gray 2023 XLT Lightning sitting on the lot.
And well, just like that day back in November, I again was sitting in the dealership for a few hours.
But this time, wearing a huge smile, I was the one driving off the lot, enjoying my own brand new Lightning😁.  
Now with two amazing trucks, my wife can now enjoy hers, and I can stop finding ways to take her truck on my daily joy rides.  
For those on the fence, and hesitant on getting into the realm of EV’s, I’ve been there.  And although I can’t speak for every brand or model, I can say without a doubt, the Ford Lightning’s are amazing.

To begin, I've been a giant Tesla fan for about a decade. Shortly after the Model S came out, although I was skeptical of EV's, I had an opportunity to test drive a Model S and I was hooked. I stretched and got a used Model S in 2015. I Absolutely loved the car, as it was so ahead of its time and so much fun to drive. I drove that car until last September, when the battery developed a leak and got water in it. 

I was a day two Cybertruck reservation holder (it took me a day to get over the shock of the look of it) and was really looking forward to getting one. The specs, price, performance, stainless steel, etc. offered a lot to look forward to, and I couldn't wait for it. Since I needed to replace my old S, I got a long range Model Y. 

I live in a rural area in PA, which tends to get our share of winter weather. When they treat the roads around here, they lay antiskid (very small gravel) on thick. Shortly into winter, I noticed lots of chips and pitting on my Model Y, as a result of the aggressive rear door/fender flares. This progressively got to a point that it really drove me nuts and I decided I won't be happy seeing this beautiful car get destroyed every winter. 

So last week, tesla emailed me about finalizing my order for the Cybertruck, to the tune of $100k for the foundation series AWD. Comparing it to the Lightning, with the recent discounts, and my recent gripes with Tesla, I decided to just go ahead and trade the Y in on a Lightning Lariat. Got it for $58k and change, which is a bargain compared to the Cybertruck. 

So far, I love the ride. It's going to take some getting used to their range calculation (dynamic vs. tesla's flat mileage consumption rate) and it barely fits in my garage. In some ways this feels like a step back from Tesla, but in many ways the lightning feels more refined and feels like it's going to hold up much better over time.

To be clear, I actually liked the design. And I'm a strong proponent of Tesla otherwise; I own a 2023 Model 3 RWD. Fantastic car and I'd recommend it all day every day.

But the 'stainless steel exoskeleton' got reduced to just be a tough outer skin, with the only 'bulletproof' component being the doors, and only on some models. 

The price turned out to be almost twice as much, with less range than they announced. 

The upper control arms look sketchy as hell. 

It doesn't have CCS support currently, or even basic Autopilot. Musk himself has even stated that because the Cybertruck is low volume right now, they're not even focusing on getting that or FSD working on the Cybertruck, so who knows how long it will be software stunted for.

And even their 4680 structural battery pack isn't anything to write home about; with the charging curve falling off a cliff at 25% and the weight/range being on par or just *slightly* better than competing EV trucks.

No onboard air compressor like they originally announced; no spare tire, and if you buy one, it has to be kept in the truck bed, which kinda kills your storage space. 

The unique shape also means you can't use a majority of the existing camping products, as I plan on using my truck for a lot of camping & light-duty overlanding. 

Their 48v LV architecture, while I understand why they did it from a manufacturing perspective, does not matter to me as a consumer--all I see are limitations in repairs.

The frunk doesn't hold a candle to the F150 Lightning.

Even the steer-by-wire system, while I don't doubt its reliability due to redundant systems, is probably an overall net-loss for offroading as you lose the tactile feedback on the steering wheel from what your wheels are doing.

The only things it has going for it that I like are the NEMA 14-50 in the bed, the built-in tonneau cover, and native access to the Supercharger network. But I feel like that's not enough to overcome the negatives.

I don't think the Cybertruck as an idea is bad, or that it was doomed to fail. It just fails to live up to expectations, or do anything really useful to make it worth it. Tesla might have stood a chance if they retained first-mover advantage in the EV truck space; but for the first time, they trailed behind the competition and the alternatives are actually pretty decent/better.

I'd have liked to have gotten a Rivian R1T, but it's a bit too far out of my price range. It would be more suited for the type of adventuring & exploration I want to do with the truck, but the F150 Lightning still ticks all the right boxes for me. The only thing that concerns me is the low ground clearance because of how low the motors hang.

Long story short, I pre-ordered an R1T waaaay back at the start and the Calgary delivery center finally opened up on Feb 1st. I made my appointment to go test drive then be matched with my R1T. In the time between my preorder and now I decided to buy a Lightning to tide me over as my other EVs had ruined me for driving gas vehicles. I had always expected to just transfer the Lightning to my company and keep the R1T for my personal use. 

Well, fast forward to yesterday and I drive up to the Rivian center and my wife and I take an absolutely GORGEOUS Forest Green R1T for a test drive. The last time I had driven an R1T was about a year ago in Las Vegas but that was a rushed affair. As expected, the R1 was brutally fast and nice to drive. But it was all the other things that you use on a daily basis that started adding up. The cupholders in the front (only two of them, no bottle pocket in the door) are the pop-out variety. No glove compartment at all. The center console is partially used up by the stupid little bluetooth speaker thing. The rear seat only has cupholders in the fold down part between the two outer seats. Which is where I'll be sticking my youngest kid's car seat since it doesn't fit rear-facing in the outboard positions. The infotainment system only has TuneIn (who the hell uses that?), Spotify and Amazon Prime music. No Audible, no Pandora, no Apple Music/Podcasts, no YT Music. So I'd be stuck using my phone over bluetooth like I was back in 2001 with an aftermarket head unit in my late 90s Accord. 

Want to adjust the mirrors? All in sub-menus in the center screen. Adjust steering wheel position? You guessed it, center screen. Vent position? Center screen. Want to engage child safety locks on the rear windows? Center screen. Wrong phone connected first for driver seat/mirror settings? Tap Rivian icon, tap username, select proper user. Why not just have a goddamn button for position 1/2/3 like Ford? These are all things I used multiple times a drive with my family in the vehicle. 

Then we get to the rest of the vehicle. The truck has a single 1400W inverter for all the outlets. That's kind of pathetic when my utility trailer has a 4000W inverter that I bought from Canadian Tire for less than $500 on sale. I've taken my Lightning camping a few times now during fire bans and having power available for a kettle to boil water and a two burner hot plate to cook on has been awesome. Either one of those things would max out the Rivian's entire power system. Not to mention I have a transfer switch in my garage that allows me to run 4 critical 120V circuits off a 20A 120V (2400W) generator. Can't do that with a max of 1500W but the frunk outlets in my Lightning can and have. 

The tonneau cover? What a stupid design that is. I have a soft roll up one on my Lightning beacuse I just use it to keep snow/water off stuff. But even a tri-fold or metal roller is easy to use. Just unlock, roll or flip them up and they're out of the way. Rivian's? Slide the individual panels out, fold them up and stow them in the gear tunnel. What a pain in the ass. 

Then we get to the wheels and tires. Rivian has decided to go with a +38 offset 5x5.5 inch bolt pattern 8.5"" wide wheel with a 33"" tire diameter. The 20"" option uses the same size tires as an F150 with 20's and the 22"" wheel uses the same size as a F150 with 22's. Lots of tire options. But - and here is the rub - the 22"" wheels don't come with a spare and the 20"" wheels MUST BE SPECCED AS PART OF THE ALL TERRAIN PACKAGE. That means to get 20"" wheels you will be spending $5100 extra in Canada and to get the 22's you'll be spending $2500 plus another $1000 for a spare. The 21"" wheels that are standard require a 275/55R21 tire and also do not come with a spare. There is ONE tire in that size and it is the OEM Rivian shitty highway tire. No winter tires, no all weather tires, no AT tires. Nothing. So if you want to drive your $100k Rivian on anything other than bare dry warm pavement you are looking at a MINIMUM of $5000 extra for wheels and tires.

Then we get to the NVH issues. Had I driven there in my brother's Mercedes GLE AMG or my old 2021 Ranger, I would have been like ""this is normal"". But, I drove there in my Lightning and the road noise, motor noise and wind noise were frankly shockingly bad in comparison.

Yeah, long story short. I thought I would be leaving the Lightning family yesterday before I went to drive the Rivian. I don't really need the full size truck. I don't haul any huge cargo. My family and I are all normal-sized humans so we don't need crazy legroom. But the simple things we use every time we drive just aren't there in the Rivian. And as much as I'd like to picture myself an intrepid overlander driving places no mortal truck could ever hope to reach - I'm just a late 30's guy that has 2 small kids, runs a pair of small-medium sized companies and has no time for epic off road adventures.

Been looking at an EV truck for years. Between the Rivian and the Lightning it seemed like both were great options but the Rivian was more geared to spirited driving and off-road performance while the Ford offered more utility and creature comforts plus a larger cabin for my kids and car seats. 

My brain knew the Platinum wasn’t worth $14k over and ER lariat, objectively. But I loved the interior on the Platinum and told myself no part of an EV truck purchase is a frugal decision, no reason to penny pinch now…

I love this truck, I do. I bought it on Saturday and already logged 250 miles but still trying to silence the cheap part of my brain that hates spending money on anything. Could use some hype up from anyone who wants to share stories.

We left our house at a 80% charge, due to cold it estimated the range to be 180 miles.

Our first stop is an IKEA 62 miles away. We arrive with 30.. miles of estimated charge. That's right, on a 62 mile flat highway run we lost 150 miles of charge  (I drove 80 most of the way). We drive around town and don't find a vanity.

On our way out we hit a fast charger (get the full 150kw/hr). Charge the car up to 65%, took like 20 minutes, left with an estimated 160 miles. Arrived home with 20 miles of range left. i drove 70-74 this time.

My take aways: Unfortunately you need to account for the wind especially driving a big truck. Apparently we drove both directions in open fields into a 20-30 mi/hr wind. I attribute this to most of our range loss outside of me going 80. I was baffled at how big of an impact it made.

Winter weather sucks for EVs, the range loss, losing charge to due heat.

DC fast chargers and the ability to take a 150 kw/hr charge gives me hope for the ev world. It was crazy how fast we were ready to go.
