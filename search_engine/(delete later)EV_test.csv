"Plug in hybrids are really the path forward right now. I really don’t want to add hours to road trips charging an EV (maybe that’s a Texan perspective, where it’s 5 hours to go anywhere at 80+mph). I would love for electricity to account for 90% of my driving to and from the gym/grocery store/etc, but when I’m on a highway, the efficiency of gas wins.

Edit to expand on my opinion: I just straight up don't believe batteries are at the technological level to handle mass adoption, let alone our infrastructure. They are slow to charge and degrade relatively quickly compared to a properly maintained engine. I'm using an iPhone 8 right now because I gave away my 12, whilst my 14 arrives this week. I have to keep it on the charger, or it will die in about 4 hours. You might be saying, ""that's because of software and forced obsolescence"". Well, sure, but do you have that much more faith in auto manufacturers' software prowess? 

Moreover, moves to force EV manufacturing by XXXX year ignore the massive income inequality in our country/world.

"I owned a Prius, (hated to give it up) and now own a Volt and Chevy Colorado diesel.  

I have often stated that it isn't one size fits all.  We don't have the technology yet and we may not ever have it.  I think we often technology will solve a problem instead of just changing our actions.

Often when I have this conversation someone always says, ""I need a big truck for my job.""  Ok, I get that.  I live in farm and ranch country and outdoor sports country.  
But, not everyone is in Contruction or ranching.  Lot of people are white collar or factory.

I had a friend that he and his wife both drove Surburban to work, alone.  

I see all these huge vehicles here in Montana that everyone seems to think they need because a few times a summer they go camping or take a boat to a lake.

Another friend bought the biggest Dodge pickup truck they made in the 90s to tow his boat and camper. 

His camper was a two-wheel pop up and his boat was a little metal job, big enough for two people and small outboard.  I could have pulled it on my bicycle.    
But he had this huge diesel engine, dual cab as his only source of transportation to his office job.

I did want a full EV but, my wife asked about what if one car breaks down and we have an emergency and have to suddenly drive across America.    
Not a lot of chargers out there and my Volt on 110V takes over 18 hours to charge; 4 on a 220.

Enter the stupid big Chevy Colorado, Diesel, (now at $5 a gallon).  I have to admit she has a point.

But overall, I drove the Volt to work and back just fine on the battery.  Some cold days I would run out of battery before getting home or the engine would run to keep things warm.

I lived in Europe and lot of places in the states and the States could take some from Europe and rethink public transportation and the size of our vehicles.","<div class=""md""><p>I owned a Prius, (hated to give it up) and now own a Volt and Chevy Colorado diesel.  </p>

I have a feeling that they’re much more likely to buy an EV maker on discount.  Rivian is having a cash problem that could affect its stock price if it continues in the direction it’s going in.  I could see Apple buying them for around $5 billion (they’re currently valued at $10 billion).  Rivian would already have the manufacturing capability in place (one of Apple’s biggest problems when it came to creating their own car) and at least a partial dealership network in place.,"<div class=""md""><p>I have a feeling that they’re much more likely to buy an EV maker on discount.

"R&D budgeting requires a lot of risk taking and acceptance that most of it will probably come up dry. That being said, I'm not really sure what Apple ever thought it was going to get out of this investment. It's an already saturated, well developed market with little room for new entrants. The capital costs of breaking in are staggering, and the profit margins aren't wild either, especially with EV margins falling. Tesla only got there recently by being first to market with a usable product and we're seeing the downstream effects of higher rates and competition catching up. 

Even if they had found some secret sauce to revolutionize transportation, I just don't see how they could have brought a product to market and have it be long term viable. A normal new car is what, $25k-$35kish? What would the Apple premium have been on a vehicle, conservatively? Whatever that price would have been would have put it WAY out of range of most consumers. Even then, at the luxury end consumers are brand loyal and I'm not sure anyone would have wanted the optics of being in an Apple car. Apple gets away with their luxury branding because even though their products outpace most of the competition in their field, they're still within reach of a lot of people. The average middle to lower class individual may have difficulty spending $1500 on a laptop, but they can probably stretch themselves to do it (I totally understand there's a lot of folks in this position who can't, but point stands that while it's a premium product it's not in the same luxury category as a Birkin bag). The average middle class person probably can't stretch themselves to say a 6ish figure vehicle. 

There also just wasn't another revolutionary field to capture here. EV's are a transition sure, but many of their devices have completely revolutionized how we interact with the world at a daily, and fundamental level. Releasing the iPhone gave them a competitive advantage in the tech industry that they've been able to heavily leverage for 15+ years now. It's why everyone was so amped up to invent the next big VR headset. There was genuine thought that VR may be the next great battleground and whoever gets there first is going to have the iPhone advantage for the next 20 years. That breakthrough was just never going to happen with vehicles and I'm struggling to see where they ever thought this might go.

"I actually recently made a financial model that looked at the total ownership costs of an EV vs an ICE car. If I was cross-shopping with an ICE powered luxury car like a Lexus ES or an Audi A4, then the EV ends up being cheaper to own after about 3-4 years and 20,000km annual mileage. But if your goal is to have the lowest cost of ownership possible, then generally speaking it takes much longer to break even on an EV compared to a cheap ICE car, or you’d have to drive a LOT for it to make financial sense.

Personally I’m not sold on EVs yet. Between the imperfect range and the crappy non-Tesla charging network, I don’t think they suit my needs right now (I also don’t like Teslas, not because they’re EVs, but because they’re Teslas… so yeah, I don’t get access to that charging infrastructure). EVs also don’t make sense for me financially given how much I drive (not a lot), and considering the opportunity cost from foregone investments (higher vehicle cost = less money for VTI). But I can also see where the market is going, EVs are an inevitability because they theoretically perfect the concept of the car as an appliance.

They’re extremely heavy, they’re basically trucks. Stock brakes on them are already huge, upgrading on these means spending a lot of money. Coilovers can improve handling but you can’t hide the weight when transferring it during high speed corners or tricky situations. Wheels, you’re forced to go with forged or similar, cast wheels with that weight won’t last long. “Engine mods”? Bro, after 2 years replacing the battery costs more than the car. Like every other battery powered device, increasing its performance automatically shortens its lifespan. Plus, this is assuming they will be able to crack oem software and assuming that people know what they’re tuning. The industry is in its full infancy, right now it’s totally not worth to modify an EV. In the future? Maybe, but ICE engine and engine related mods are those that give the car character. Uploading space sounds in your usb won’t have the same effect. Not saying they suck, as daily drivers they’re absolutely fantastic once the grid gets sorted, but as passion objects, fuck that man. My nipples don’t get hard while looking at a washing machine.","<div class=""md""><p>As a daily, great</p>

<p>As a fun car, to drive and modify, fuck no</p>

When approaching the big shift to EV’s, *maybe*, just maybe, it wasn’t the most helpful idea to try to guilt and shame everyone for destroying the planet.

You made enemies of them. No fucking wonder they’re desperate to watch EV’s fail- their success means they lose a war they didn’t even want to fight.

"“Another way to look at it is the energy required to produce an average EV's battery is equivalent to about 74 gallons of gas.” 

Come again? Calling BS on this claim. It’s well known producing an EV battery uses tons of energy to produce. If it takes two years break-even to ICE in emissions (as the article claims) then how in the world would producing an EV battery be the equivalent of 74 gallons of fuels? Logically, that makes no sense. If you drove an ICE for two years, say 30k miles, averaging 30 mpg then wouldn't that mean it would have to take 1000 gallons to produce the EV? Otherwise, where would the additional CO2 emissions be coming from in the production of the EV taking it two years to break-even with ICE? 

I'm also skeptical of the claim that it’s two years to break even. Every study I saw was 60-80k miles when I dug into it. Still advantage EV though. Maybe if you compare a tiny EV and not something with a massive battery. I wonder what the break-even of a long range EV vs a PHEV would be. I’d bet it’s over 100k assuming the PHEV plugs in regularly. 

The author is a hack and it’s very clear no one even read the article because egregious error would be called out. The entire tone of the article is one of a fart sniffing elitist. Especially bad when he has blatant misinfo in his own article.

Owning an ev is best when you can charge at home. Being able to use public chargers is also okay, but there really aren’t any around me that would suffice. For example, the closest within 10 minutes is one in a parking lot that closes at night around 8pm, and is only 6kw.

"And water is wet?

Anyone who isn't a complete bootlicking moron knows most Americans live paycheck to paycheck. 

It's not a controversial political issue. Despite what media and social media says, wanting a roof over your head, healthy food to eat, reliable transportation, and some savings isn't political. 

Every working class American needs a 20-30k pay bump across the board. Rent, student loans, and healthcare need to be reworked, and eat a huge chunk of worker income in this country.

No matter what people say, cry, or scream, money is the all encompassing factor that drives (no pun intended) the entire automotive hobby. When people have no money, enthusiast cars go away. When people have no money, working class car options go away until the market adjusts. 

More money in working class people's pockets will always equate to more market options. It's why from the 1950s to the 08 recession, American car buyers had more options than we knew what to do with. 

Now in 2023, we have our lovely choice of overpriced CUV, with a sprinkling of truck and car options. 

So before you hit that reply button with a sassy rebuttal, let me repeat this. More money for average people equals more cars and car options. It's not political, it's literally just how the market works. Also if your car tag has Porsche or some six figure car manufacture, please use some self awareness when commenting on the economic health of working class people.","<div class=""md""><p>And water is wet?</p>

<p>Until battery and charger tech is able to fully and functionally compete with gas station refueling, it will continue to be a psychological challenge to dethrone the gasoline car.</p>

"Cost aside, EVs are also not viable for most people who live in an apartment (unless the building has a parking garage with chargers) - and not viable for anyone who has street parking.

I don't know about you, but there's a LOT of people in my city who rely on street parking.

So to own an EV with no hassle, you have to be rich and own a house or garage that you can put a charger in. And/or work at a white-collar job which has chargers in the parking garage.

This is why I think hydrogen is the best solution to zero-emission vehicles going forward. They refuel in minutes just like gasoline (so are suitable for people who are forced to park on the street), but they have no emissions just like electric. We just need massive infrastructure upgrades to have hydrogen pumps at all the current gas stations and a huge investment in solar to provide clean hydrogen.

We have some way to go.","<div class=""md""><p>Cost aside, EVs are also not viable for most people who live in an apartment (unless the building has a parking garage with chargers) - and not viable for anyone who has street parking.</p>

"Counterpoint, EVs are too expensive because they pop in useless bullshit that's not necessary for a vehicle to operate.

Teslas and Rivians have motorized door handles that pop out when you approach the vehicle. Why? To shave .0001 coefficient of drag? WOW Factor? I dunno. I like actual door handles. I live in an area where it gets icy in the winter. I do not want those items to fail.

Some models of EV have a motor to control the air vents and you use the touchscreen to aim the air at your face. Every other car has a little flappy plastic louver vent. The motor is more expensive, weighs more, and is more failure prone than a flappy plastic louver.

I don't need a 17 inch touchscreen to control my EV's everything. I like physical buttons for the HVAC. There's haptic feedback and I don't have to delve into a system of menus to adjust anything. I don't have to take my eyes off the road to make it hotter or cooler or defrost the windows.

I definitely don't need self driving/autopilot/etc.

A simple 8 inch display is fine for infotainment. Or hell... Give me a rectangle Double DIN shaped hole in the dash and a pair of wires to each corner of the car where speakers would be located and let me slam in a stereo system of my choosing. No more obsolescence of Android Auto or Apple CarPlay.

OBD PIDs are standardized already and we have stereos with interfaces to read the OBD PIDs. (I currently have a Kenwood head unit with an iDataLink Maestro RR2 in a car and it reads all the ECU data on the stereo.)

I want a basic, compact, 2 wheel drive, 4 door sedan or hatchback for under 25-30k NEW.
Give me 200ish miles of range under ideal circumstances (Because I know it'll drop in the winter.)

"In my experience, EVs can slow slightly faster than a car coasting without brake lights using light regen. However, if you find that annoying or even slightly dangerous I think you might not actually have as safe of a following distance as you think you do, which is very common. A safe following distance of 3 seconds should allow you to stop even if a vehicle in front comes to an instantaneous stop, due to a collision. So any collision resulting from light regen would have to involve severe tailgating and/or inattentiveness, and arguably even full braking with inoperative brake lights.

I actually like that EVs can decelerate more without brake lights, because it allows me to more quickly identify possible full braking when I can already easily accommodate for light regen without brake lights.","<div class=""md""><p>In my experience, EVs can slow slightly faster than a car coasting without brake lights using light regen.

"Sequential combination large brake lights are more attention grabbing than your typical tiny single halogen amber blinkers.     There are pros and cons to both designs, with split, the brake lights and blinkers have to share real-estate, and so both become smaller all else equal.   With combination, both can be larger, and the larger size can allow for sequential designs and humans are VERY good at detecting movement even in the peripheral.  

Now the obvious best solution is switchback lighting, and the Mustang with switchback amber sequential is the best of both worlds.   When braking you have a massive brake light on each side of the vehicle, and when changing lanes you have a massive sequential amber light that further distinguishes itself. 

All a bit moot though, as blinker usage is far more of a factor than blinker design.  In Houston even the police pretty much universally refuse to use their blinkers when drifting between lanes on the highway.","<div class=""md""><p>Sequential combination large brake lights are more attention grabbing than your typical tiny single halogen amber blinkers.

"I think the easy solution here is to use the accelerometer and then, once it reaches 0 mph, it keeps the brake lights on. Otherwise, you have to program in a whole braking threshold curve based on current speed and current throttle position (holding steady at 5 mph will be a different % of pedal travel than holding steady at 75 mph), regen aggressiveness setting/mode, and translate that to a specific G-force.

Let's say you're traveling steady at 75 mph, and holding your throttle pedal at 15% travel with your car set to max regen/1-pedal-drive mode. If you let off a bit from 15% travel to 10% travel, the car will slow down to, say, 45 mph, but now that 10% travel is holding you steady at 45 mph. And if you were only going 5 mph with 5% travel, and pushed the pedal a bit back up to 10% travel, it'd speed up to 45 mph and hold steady again.

My point is...that very same ""10% pedal travel"" could result in acceleration, deceleration or holding steady, based on your current speed. So you'd need to know the exact g-force translation that each speed/pedal-position/regen-mode combination would result in (millions of potential combinations).............or just have an accelerometer that kicks on at a set g-force level of deceleration and holds the brake lights on once stopped.","<div class=""md""><p>I think the easy solution here is to use the accelerometer and then, once it reaches 0 mph, it keeps the brake lights on.

"This is not surprising.   

The crash protection in an F150 was already certified.  The brakes were certified, etc.   

Making a car electric is not as hard as making a car that will pass standards.   90% of the F150 passed standards, it only has to re-certify with the new bits.   The Cybertruck has to certify the whole truck.     

Electric motors have been around a long time.  Mosfets have been around 50 years.      Sure, the batteries for this new crop of EV were lab stuff 30 years ago, but Ford simply bought the batteries, like Tesla did up until a couple years ago.

If it were easy to make a new car, we'd have more new cars.      This makes me mistrustful of these new electric car makers.  They have significant hurdles way beyond being electric.

"Lol good luck getting a Prius prime under 40k even at base.  I was getting 8k markup for base Prius when I talked to a couple of dealerships.

Prius made the most fiscal sense but instead I’ll keep saving home for dream home and working on my student loans.  I can’t with this crazy market.

"Having comercially sold electric motors definetly makes me think that electric swaps are gonna be a part of, if not the main future of car tuning. Taking a super old car chassis with broken engines and making a cursed electric super car out of it sounds really fun, kinda like a Rich Rebuilds video.

Being able to electric swap cars could also be the best way to lower emmisions. Although electric cars are zero emmisions when your driving, it dosent solve the considerable emmisions from the metal work and industry required to make new cars. Its why you often hear its better to use your current car to its max before buying a new electric one. An electric swap would solve both of these problems at once with less resources used. It would get you moral peace of mind, a car with much better performance, and a bunch of ICE car parts you can sell.

Now electric swapping to make a practical car would require battery technology to be much more dense for range, since there would likely be less room in a car made for engines to put in batteries. I definetly think it can get there within 10 years though, judging from the massive improvements the technology has already seen in this decade, on top of the money/investment entering the industry.","<div class=""md""><p>Having comercially sold electric motors definetly makes me think that electric swaps are gonna be a part of, if not the main future of car tuning.

"I hope that the manufacturers announcing all electric fleets can make it happen, but I seriously, like 10:1, doubt it happens.  If all electric means ""EVs and hybrids,"" then I can see that happen.

Don't get me wrong, I think EVs are the future, but without significant advances in battery and charging infrastructure, they're going to remain a car that puts the driver in a significant penalty box.  It is just hard for folks to grasp how much energy is in a gallon of gasoline or diesel.  

For instance, in much of the US, you cannot charge a Tesla outside right now, it is simply too cold unless you use battery power to warm the battery for a few hours first.  If you use your heater in sub-zero temps, you're likely going to cut range by 1/2 or 1/3.

IMO, what EVs need is an optional small engine that can charge the batteries while moving or while stopped.  The engine would just need to have enough power to charge the batteries, even if slowly, while driving at highway speeds with heating or AC running.  The advantage of an engine dedicated solely to charging and not to direct propulsion is that it can be designed to operate at its most efficient speed, reducing the size of engine needed and greatly increasing efficiency, thus reducing the size of fuel tank needed.

I'm thinking an improvement on something like this:  https://www.motorauthority.com/news/1039971_lotus-omnivore-engine-gains-10-efficiency-over-direct-injection","<div class=""md""><p>I hope that the manufacturers announcing all electric fleets can make it happen, but I seriously, like 10:1, doubt it happens.

"It looks like they're saying all vehicle launches from 2025 will be electric only, and that would leave open the option of continuing to sell the existing combustion models for some years afterwards. That would be similar to the strategy Porsche has with the Macan, the new model is going to be electric in 2023, and the old combustion version will get a remodel to look like the electric version, and continue to be sold for some period of time.

In general I think this basically means the entirety of Jaguar will be directly in competition with the J1/PPE platform from VW group (used to build the Taycan, E-Tron GT and the new Macan), I think that's a good place to go, and by concentrating solely on that area they stand a decent chance of competing.

"PHEVs are great in the near term and are 100% viable, even if you only have 20 miles of EV range it helps a ton with short trips and getting efficiency out of a gasoline engine. Being able to drive a short trip or shuffle cars in a garage on pure EV power helps a lot with avoiding excessive cold starts on a gasoline engine. ICE really suffers from much higher emissions and severely degraded fuel economy if the engine is being driven while cold all the time. 

Another benefit of PHEV is that you can delay starting the engine until you get out of a congested area with a lot of stop lights. You can use the EV mode to get on a main road, accelerate, then flick on the hybrid mode to start the engine while coasting. After letting it build oil pressure you can immediately put load on it and reduce the time spent idling the engine significantly.

Larger batteries also help a lot with maintaining performance in a PHEV. A normal hybrid may deplete the battery completely on a long uphill stretch of highway and lose some power/fuel efficiency as the engine has to rev higher, then on the downhill the battery will fully charge and fail to recapture a lot of the energy spent getting up the hill. PHEVs are a lot more likely to avoid full discharge or full charge in these scenarios.","<div class=""md""><p>PHEVs are great in the near term and are 100% viable, even if you only have 20 miles of EV range it helps a ton with short trips and getting efficiency out of a gasoline engine. Being able to drive a short trip or shuffle cars in a garage on pure EV power helps a lot with avoiding excessive cold starts on a gasoline engine. ICE really suffers from much higher emissions and severely degraded fuel economy if the engine is being driven while cold all the time. </p>

<p>Another benefit of PHEV is that you can delay starting the engine until you get out of a congested area with a lot of stop lights. You can use the EV mode to get on a main road, accelerate, then flick on the hybrid mode to start the engine while coasting. After letting it build oil pressure you can immediately put load on it and reduce the time spent idling the engine significantly.</p>

"I don't agree with this.  Even if the assumption is given that burning a fossil fuel creates the electricity stored in the battery, electric propulsion is still a more efficient use of energy from well to wheel.  Internal combustion engines convert a great deal of the stored energy  in the fuel to heat.  This dissipates into the environment and does nothing to propel the vehicle at all.

An argument can be made that the thermal efficiency used to create the electricity in a coal plant is only around 40% and that a lot of the energy is lost in heat similar to an internal combustion engine.  However combined cycle gas power plants achieve around 60% thermal efficiency and the electric propulsion itself is close to 80%.  The best that internal combustion can do is around 30%.

As just an average person, my opinion is that it's better all around, environmentally and in terms of the efficient use of a finite resource (coal/natural gas/petroleum), to shift to electric vehicles in the long term.","<div class=""md""><p>I don&#39;t agree with this.

"I think he's actually quite right, at least for the region.

In Japan, only around 17% of greenhouse gas emissions are from road vehicles and unlike most of the world they're dropping every year. The vast majority of Japan's emissions are from electricity generation. In addition to that, because it's a resource-poor country almost certainly all the electricity for battery electric vehicles would come from burning coal, if not by expanding coal use by preventing the country from retiring its many coal plants as they expand renewables given the massive increase in demand.  

(Fuel cell cars are a little different because of methane hydrates in the surrounding ocean that could make blue hydrogen, but still unlikely to be true zero emissions until much later and any natural gas used again would better be used for electricity.) 

For Japan, planning to ban ICEs this early is a feel-good measure. Cynically, it's a distraction from the government's failure to take enough action on coal electricity generation and will give the government an excuse to continue to fail to do so (""we need to keep the plants for the electric cars that are coming!"").

With the exception of certain parts of Europe and California, similar logic holds for many places that have announced such plans (China for example, though China's ban allows for hybrids so it's different).","<div class=""md""><p>I think he&#39;s actually quite right, at least for the region.</p>

"I don't feel this is that unreasonable and is rather realistic. 

EVs don't work for everyone and it will take a while for the US to reach a supportive infrastructure level capable of sustaining widespread EV adoption. Even then, battery support after a vehicle's ""typical lifespan"" of 10-15 years is a lingering issue and will remain a concern until \~$5k \[reputable\] refurb packs are available. Many of us need to admit that we're not too personally concerned with this, as trading our current EV in after 4-8 years towards a different or newer model will offset the concern of battery support. Battery usage is also dynamic based on environmental factors. This variability needs to be minimized for the population that can't accept a \~20-80 mile variance. As a Minnesotan, I've come to expect these variances and plan accordingly, but this is a tall order for the general public.

There should also be more regulation in certain aspects. We've been enjoying our MYP, but we're left disappointed in Tesla's decisions regarding ""Vision"" and other functions. Tesla's charging network remains incredible, however, and we've loved the experience. We'd like to transition to the IX or R1S/R2S, but we've decided to wait until NACS is fully adopted. We also await the ability to \[hopefully\] provide a seamless charging experience for any EV through an automated charging-port exchange of vehicle information for billing.

I imagine, within the next 5-10 years, EVs will settle into a position of being a normalized ""luxury"" vehicle. Not ""luxury"" as in full-grain leather and B&W audio, but ""luxury"" relating to lifestyle capability to facilitate EV ownership.

I can see the argument if you look at global market share. It's going to take a while for countries with more unstable or more expensive power grids to convert to using EV.

"as an EV owner I kinda agree here, at least for next 10 years I dont see that rising more than 30%, not with current tech, and we are still not sure how we going to charge that shitton of cars. 

There are traffic jams in Dubai petrol stations, and it takes freaking minutes to tank. Electricity is another story, most countries grids are fucking old, and unable to handle so many chargers.

EVs are great, they may not give such a thrill while driving, and no mechanical feel, but they are  great and have their share on the market.

I think the future is behind combustion engines that use hydrogen, I think Toyota and some other companies showed such prototypes that actually work, just not sure why they are not selling those cars just yet. Maybe the efficiency is even worse than ICE petrol cars, who knows.

Honestly I dont know any country that would be able to handle such amount of electricity consumption, maybe France with their nuclear energy, which they are expanding even further, but Germany for instance closed all nuclear power stations recently, migrating back to coal, thats dumb.

Battery costs, economies of scale, optimized software defined vehicles, 48v systems, gigapresses, improved charging speeds, improved charging networks are all rapidly driving us towards better, cheaper, more convenient EVs every few years. 

It's like blockbuster and cable companies looking at netflix and snickering when the only way to access it was home theater PCs or a handful of bad DVD player apps and pointing to slow internet speeds and laggy playback to say streaming media has no future. They failed to see a future with cheap gigabit home internet or ubiquitous $25 streaming media sticks that made everything seamless.

2022 Maverick

With the Accord, the dealership posted a reasonable price on their website. When I asked for it at that price, they admitted it was a lie just to get people like me in the door. 

With the Fit, we were on the search for a top trim Fit in a specific color. A nearby dealership had one so we called to schedule an appointment to come look at it. We drive 30 minutes to get there and, WHOOPS, turns out they didn't have it! But they had other, more expensive cars we could look at.

With the Maverick, no one at the dealer had any information or knowledge about it. At all. It was basically an Renault or Vauxhall to them. Luckily I was able to order exactly what I wanted and their involvement was minimal.

Dealerships have some use to people who don't quite know what they want and are too lazy or disinterested to do research themselves, and for some reason trust for-commission salesmen to give them an honest assessment.

I like to believe we are trying to do right by our clients. We still accept factory employee &quot;invoice&quot; deals and VIP certificates. Am I killing it like other people I know? No. But I take pride in my job and doing the right thing. We cant be alone.</p>

It would be much better if dealerships were owned by the manufacturers to have standardized services and customer support across the board.

The lease and finance incentives that you (used to) see on certain cars were rolled down from the manufacturers anyway.

"Yeah this is actually a pretty poor report... though I'd expect nothing less from Consumer Reports that has been an awful rag for at least a decade.

This is classing trim and rattle issues as a reliability issue which it just isn't. And Tesla for all the great stuff they have accomplished have definitely had a massive problem with fit and finish which has skewed these numbers to an atrocious degree.

You go look at EV's from established car manufacturers who have experience in fit and finish and you'll find a different story entirely. My Polestar 2 has been insanely reliable; it hasn't left me stranded once in 2 years and 36,000 miles except yesterday when an augur bit lying in the road punched through my tire and rim... hardly a problem with the car. It has been in the shop twice; once for maintenance and once for a headlight unit that failed. By time I had my previous ICE vehicle for that amount of time I'd had electronic issues that had stalled the car twice, a fuel pump replaced and been through a total of 3 tires and two rims due to damage on the roads. 

EV's have far fewer critical moving parts to fail and have a surprising amount of redundancy built in. Heck, a critical failure of a motor won't even necessarily stop most dual-motor EV's unless it fails in a way that freezes up the drive shaft.","<div class=""md""><p>Yeah this is actually a pretty poor report... though I&#39;d expect nothing less from Consumer Reports that has been an awful rag for at least a decade.</p>

"EVs aren't for everyone, despite what r/electricvehicles say.

However Canada is a small market in the world view from automakers perspective. The waiting list for EVs here is ridiculous, and slimey sellers (both dealers and private parties) are only too keen on charging above market costs to make a quick buck to make it even harder.

Add to that the fragmented charging infrastructure (I've had good and bad experiences) with a government which despite all of their empty promises still have very tiny incentives to motivate buyers to make the switch doesn't help. The US $7.5k tax credit, the Chinese NEVS license scheme etc. are far stronger efforts to get EVs on the roads.

"What is the point? Manuals are fun because they give a feeling of being physically connected to the internals of the car. Their is no loud engine to rev out to the redline. The car will not mechanically punish you for getting a gear change wrong. The car won't jerk forward by letting the clutch out too quick. It won't stall because you didn't use enough of the accelerator pedal. Their is no finding the biting point to pull away smoothly while doing a hill start using the handbrake.

Its like fake grills, vents, exhausts and engine noise. Its there to give the illusion of performance. I love a manual as much as anyone else but I know full well that it has a shelf life and its tombstone is already being chiseled as we speak.

"I am likely considered an early adopter. First EV only had 80 miles of range. My current one has about 260. I have daily driven both for the past 5 years. I don’t work a typical office 9-5 I drive around frequently through out the day between getting supplies, going to lunch, going back to work site, going to check on other sites. When I had 80 miles range I’d be able to get by during the summer with less than 5 miles left on range indicator. In the winter I’d have to go home(I’m always local) by late afternoon and switch to my ICE vehicle while the EV charges. 

I understand not everybody has a schedule as flexible as mine but just because it doesn’t work for a situation doesn’t mean they’re all bad. No where in my mind have I ever considered taking any EV on a road trip. I have a gas car for that. My EV charger at home was “paid for” by the fuel savings of the first EV. Right now I am driving for roughly $4 a day in energy on the high side. A prius would run about $5 or so spending on fuel prices. But a traditional hybrid would also require oil changes every year so that effects the cost to run. My EVs have been turn key since new other than tires and brakes. I don’t even care about the savings but it’s nice driving past gas stations when gas is $5 a gallon. A ford lightning would be perfectly fine in my situation, compared to the gas equivalent.

waging the finger at ford is complete non-sense.  the whole damn electric vehicle industry is in a pre-beta right now and is not ready for regular interstate usage let alone seasonal/holiday when volume of vehicles and required charging/range are increased.

"My problem isn't the fees, I have no problem paying my fair share. My problem is that in many states these are treated differently than the gas tax which has legislative consequences. 

I don't know how Texas is, but in Missouri where I live, our gas tax hasn't increased since the early 90s. Not even for inflation. Why? Because according to the state constitution, all tax increases have to be approved by voters. There have been many ballot initiatives to try to increase the gas tax. Unsurprisingly, they have all failed.

When I bought my car in 2019, the EV fee was around 80 dollars, which was roughly equivalent to what you'd pay in gas taxes, driving a typical car an average amount of mileage, and I was fine with that. It was fair. 

But the EV isn't a tax. It doesn't need voter approval to increase it. Legislators can vote to increase it willy nilly and without having to worry about an attack ad that says ""So-and-so voted to increase taxes!"" in the next election cycle. This year, my EV fee was over $100, and they're increasing it to $200 over the next few years.

IMO, EV fees need to be tied to gas taxes. They need to start at approximately what the typical driver pays in gas taxes. Then, if the gas tax goes up 10%, increase the EV fee 10%. If you can't convince voters to increase gas taxes once in 30 years, then EV fees shouldn't go up either.","<div class=""md""><p>My problem isn&#39;t the fees, I have no problem paying my fair share.

"on the one hand, I get the argument that this is just filling in for the gas tax EVs don't pay, which (according to commenters) mostly goes to the infrastructure that EVs will be using. On the other hand, even though I don't plan to buy an EV anytime soon (and even if they are not a cure-all for climate change) I do think there is good reason to incentivize their purchase for emissions reasons, and this does the opposite. I do wish there were more boring, cheap EVs and good charging infrastructure for them - and this (slightly) dis-incentivizes EV purchase in Texas .

On the other other hand most (not all) EVs are pretty expensive right now, and I'm not that into giving wealthy people even more tax breaks on top of the incentives there already are. Those tax breaks are not accessible unless you can afford a pricy car - and yes I consider paying mid-$30s to $40k to be relatively pricy or even unobtainable for many americans.","<div class=""md""><p>on the one hand, I get the argument that this is just filling in for the gas tax EVs don&#39;t pay, which (according to commenters) mostly goes to the infrastructure that EVs will be using.

"This thread is the living embodiment of why it's so hard to get shit done in government.

EV's need roads to fucking function, yes? Eventually you would like the best majority of cars to be EV's, yes? Well see maintaining those roads relies on taxing gas that EV's don't use. Therefore wanting everyone to make the jump to EV's *will also mean everyone will have to pay this fee*.

Given those facts I think it's incredibly petty to throw a fit over a few tens of dollars.

(sync isn't perfect). All 3 cars are >4600lbs. The Tesla has >300hp more than the Taycan or AMG GT. Taycan and AMG GT are on stickier tires.

What can we learn from this?

* The yoke is ridiculous on track
* The Plaid is sketchy (many oppo corrections) and definitely has a tire and brake deficit vs the Germans
* It also has an aero deficit as the Merc and Taycan are sometimes \~25kph (\~15mph) faster through certain medium/high speed corners. That's a lot.
* The Plaid actually has very good low speed grip

Based on this... I don't expect the Roadster to do better than about 6:50. Maybe less with R compound tires.

<li>The Plaid is sketchy (many oppo corrections) and definitely has a tire and brake deficit vs the Germans</li>

"I adore how many people don’t know what they are talking about when it comes to underwhelming and listing dedicated performance track cars as bench marks. Tesla has not made and I doubt we will ever see a factory “GT3” model s. So to compare GT3 spec production car times to a family sedan is insane. 

* It’s on 4S tires not cup 2s
* it’s on stock suspension with no track alignment (thus all the understeer)
* it still has its full interior including back seats (no reduction of interior for weight savings)
* it has 0 aerodynamic additions to control cornering optimization
* it is not a “track tuned” GT3/4 model or trim of the car

Are you all so confused on how tracking times work? Do you really think if Tesla didn’t want to shed its “luxury” only mentality and actually produce a GT3 level trim of the Model S that it wouldn’t compare to beat most of the times listed?

If they wanted to produce a stripped out, roll caged, aero covered, track aligned suspension, ultra stiff GT3 car they’d probably crush the boards - how can you be sure??? Because those who have been track modifying these cars are WINNING major events…most recently Randy Pobst in his model s at Pikes Peak.

If Tesla truly wanted the crown it would take them shedding away the foundation of SEXY that they’ve done and going all in on making a performance division. I doubt we will ever see it, but if they ever did…good luck to everyone else.","<div class=""md""><p>I adore how many people don’t know what they are talking about when it comes to underwhelming and listing dedicated performance track cars as bench marks.

"*un-nerf* … I have never heard that. You mean *buff*? 

Usually this is called *unlocking*. Keep up or get out of the fast lane.

Price discrimination is a way for manufacturers to offer a similar product to a range of customers, allowing them to offer lower prices *only* to those unwilling to pay higher. I don’t mind my cheap flights being subsidized by overpriced hot towels in first class.

Doing it in software, with free-to-play and pay-for-swag is a way to get a lot bigger user base.

I would love get into a Tesla or Mercedes at subsidized prices on the likelihood that richies will buy the swag. I might buy swag myself later. Upfront costs are the issue with electric cars right now, and the subscription/swag model is working great with my Switch, Nintendo, and Call of Duty Mobile game. 

I find it funny that the same Boomers who will talk your ears off about how leasing a car will save you so much money and hassle will then cry foul about software subscriptions. It is the same thing.","<div class=""md""><p><em>un-nerf</em> … I have never heard that. You mean <em>buff</em>? </p>

"Honestly I dislike this thing greatly. It has at least a 200 kWh and gets only 318 miles of range, making it the least efficient EV by a large margin. GMC is hyping up charge times saying it gets 100 miles of range in 10 minutes without mentioning that they've pretty much doubled home charging times over other EVs. The inefficiency pretty much eliminates the reduced cost of fueling an EV in many parts of the country. It really doesn't look very capable off road on account of the long wheelbase and presumably enormous weight. Other than being fast and big it really has no redeeming qualities.

Ford is working toward a practical electric truck. Tesla is making practical electric daily drivers. Other companies are joining in and making EVs that are actually good, but GMC has created nothing more than a toy for rich people. I can understand it may be made to excite people about their future EVs but it just seems like a stunt to me.","<div class=""md""><p>Honestly I dislike this thing greatly.

"It makes sense to be honest, we already have the EV PROLOGUE SUV, it only makes sense we also get a PRELUDE to go along with the PROLOGUE considering they’re 2 of the same words that are just antonyms of each other. The real hard part is determining if it’ll go into production or not, and if it’ll come to the US.

But so far I’m pretty hyped with Honda AND Subaru revealing EV sports concepts THIS MONTH in Tokyo.

If this actually becomes a thing I will be very happy with Honda, their lineup is also very appealing lately. And even though it’s coming to an end anywhere from a couple of years to several I’m glad they still have big N/A engines in some of their cars, hard to find other brands doing this.

"> the Kia EV6 is based on the new dedicated EV platform: Electric-Global Modular Platform (E-GMP), which allows building EVs with very strong specs, including a long-range of 500 km (311 miles), ultra-fast charging capability (replenishing 100 km/62 miles of range in 4 minutes) and acceleration 0-100 km/h (62 mph) in 3 seconds. The exact specs of the EV6 model are not yet announced.

An EV which has 300 miles of range (so at least 200 miles of real range) combined with being able to get back up to 200 miles of real range in 15-20 minutes would deal with most people's issues with EVs. 

At this point the change needed is on the public infrastructure (aka government investment) side rather than the manufacturer side. If the charging experience becomes identical for EVs as it is for ICE cars, I think EVs would really take off.","<div class=""md""><blockquote>

"Nice work by GM, they have impressive EV tech. No doubt they will have strong EV offerings to come. I grew up in a GM family and root for them. 

Now, I am curious about EV impact on cars in general though. What happens to cars like Civic SI, Elantra N line, Golf GTI, Veloster/Elantra N, Corolla, Camaro, Mustang, Challenger, Charger, BRZ/86, Golf R, and the rest of that segment in the 20-50K range that offer manual transmissions, good overall range, and lightweight sporty/sports cars(with some exceptions)? Do automakers want to kill these cars soon or will they fight for them to remain ICE? 

If these cars go EV, how heavy will they be and get they offer similar value or will they get much more costly? Like if Honda Civic SI went EV, I don't see it how they can make it fun with pure EV powertrain, cost 26K, have solid range, and be lightweight. 

So far, we have seen Camaro might be killed off, rumors of Camaro-like EV, Mustang due to go full EV but with suv offering and now supposed sedan offerring on the way. Mustang coupe may die off? Challenger/Charger living on until 2024 with ICE. No news on what comes after that.

"The new US spec LWB (LWB is also coming to Europe) ID.Buzz is finally out! 

It gets a lot of new things from the ID.7. It has the ID.7’s new infotainment system (although the Buzz display is a tad smaller 12.9in vs 15in) with VW’s newest software and illuminated center climate and volume touch sliders (finally!), the new APP550 motor launched on the ID.7 which produces 282hp and 406lb-ft of torque - up a lot from the 201hp and 229lb-ft of the previous motor while simultaneously being more efficient, a new AWD powertrain is also now an option with around 330hp and no torque figure yet, it also seems to have the same 86kW useable 91kW gross pack as the ID.7 which has a 200kW peak charging speed.

Despite the increased size vs the SWB, it’s still a lot smaller than a traditional minivan which I really like, but without sacrificing that much interior room. 7 or 6 seats only, but you can fold them or completely remove the third row seats for cargo.

The electrochromatic glass roof, ventilated seats, massaging seats, heated rear seats, a USB-C port near the windshield for a dashcam, 14 speaker Harmon/Kardon sound system, 360 camera and heads up display are really nice new additions.

The new color combos look great too, I’m digging the new cabana blue and new classic style rims are awesome too! I hope they bring a white and red model soon.

The fact that the rear windows can’t fully roll down is still lame, I think it’s for styling and aero but I’d still like to have my rear windows to fully roll down. Luckily this LWB has a power slider that opens in the rear window, better than the no rear window ventilation that the SWB has. That’s honestly my biggest gripe with it, and it’s not a big one. 

Official pricing is later and it’s not going on sale until 2024 :( 

I really am in love with this thing, it just has so much character. By far the most character for a minivan or a van and arguably the most character from a BEV in general. It’s such a refreshing feel to see this instead of another crossover. It’s just so good. I have no doubt these will be very expensive, not the $70k or $80k some are saying it will be, less than that, but still expensive. It’ll probably sell well regardless, I want one very very badly and I am excited to see them on the road!","<div class=""md""><p>The new US spec LWB (LWB is also coming to Europe) ID.Buzz is finally out! </p>

However, I don’t think it’s going to be that successful among the minivan faithful for a few reasons:

1. It’s somewhat small inside.  The third row bench only seating two people? The cargo space behind the third row also looks abysmal.  

2. The estimated range is probably not going to be high.  I would say it’s going to be 250 miles at most. For people that take vans on long road trips, it’s just not going to be as convenient. 

3. The pricing.  A fully loaded Sienna is around $55k and I can’t imagine this will start any lower than $50k and will go up to $65k or more for a fully loaded model.

EV owner, enthusiast and auto tech for nearly 20 years here is my take 


A large reason why people are switching is not only to take advantage of the incentives but also the cheaper running costs. Where I live I got 12k in incentive, 1000$ for a home charger and electricity is 7c KWh. My EV costs pennies to operate and I don’t have to deal with going to the gas station 

I was just in the UK with a rental Polestar 2 and had to use roadside DCFCs which weren’t horribly expensive but likely the same as petrol. But the people I spoke with said they mostly charge at home and it’s still cheaper. So pretty much the same story as home. 95% of charging at home and the rest dcfc 

EVs are a pleasure to drive and you start to notice how much ICE cars do smell and just aren’t as nice to drive. We still have an ICE car in our driveway but it’s been relegated to the “runabout” driven maybe 2-3x a week 

Would I toss out a good ice car for an EV? Well it depends how much life is left in the ICE car. I don’t keep our car over 80000km or 5 years. So I can still have something worth it on trade. If the incentives are still good within the next two years ill take advantage of them again. 

I tell everyone that we are still in the infancy of EVs much like ICE was 120 years ago. Things get better on a monthly basis and there are more and more on the road","<div class=""md""><p>EV owner, enthusiast and auto tech for nearly 20 years here is my take </p>

"Electric cars have definitely become the subject of what I would almost describe as a culture war - and it’s drawn along political lines accordingly.

Personally, I don’t like electric cars as enthusiast cars. They’re missing a lot of what I (and some others) feel is the visceral experience of a car, and the personality each individual car has. The sound, the characteristics of the engine, the ability to modify, the ability to row your own gears, etc. not to mention it’s not really conducive to my lifestyle or driving habits. Yea they’re fast and have instant torque, but you can’t deny that it’s a different experience, and some don’t prefer it. 

But the more I’ve thought about this issue I think there’s one key theme. Electric cars are not a panacea. Their adoption would be fantastic for certain applications - fleet vehicles, people who don’t take long trips, people who use cars only as appliances, have easy access to charging, etc. 

I FULLY support the aggressive adoption of EV’s in the areas that make the most of what they have to offer, and where the concerns about their shortcomings aren’t as relevant. 

I would ideally like to see a corner of the market still remain for gasoline enthusiast vehicles. Maybe a niche, maybe more than that. Because gas powered cars are still more “likeable” where emotions are involved to the exclusion of utility.

So I wish that manufacturers would lead the charge on electrics with vehicles for which it makes more sense. Not try to force stubborn folks like me to go right from the classic musclecar formula, for example, right to the flagship halo car being an electric facsimile of that type of model

If you want to have a reasonable discussion about this, I’m game. If you want to make snarky comments and just mock the fact that I enjoy what gas cars have to offer, or be argumentative and call me stubborn and living in the past, I’ll just block you.

"I live in China. Besides the fact that Teslas are enormously popular here, the government gives gigantic subsidies to domestic EV manufacturers, with the result that there are more domestic EV manufacturers than mushrooms after an autumn rain now and you can get a generic no-name white electric sedan or compact SUV for the same or less than a decent gas car of equivalent size. EVs also get fancy green-and-white gradient plates instead of the standard blue license plates. In my city, all the buses and taxis are EVs now and EVs very often outnumber normal vehicles on the road when I'm cruising to and from my work in the city center.

I can't help but think they're all fools.

"I went EV for my main commuter a few months ago, but I also have the benefit of living in a house with solar so it works very well for me.  Charging works out to be around 10 to 25% of the cost of petrol (depending on how much I'm able to source from my solar).  It's hard to charge on the solar when the car's parked at work, but I try to maximise solar charging on Friday (I'll commute in our ICE car), Saturday and Sunday.

It was purely for financial reasons, there are significant tax advantages for leasing arrangements in Australia plus the aforementioned costs to run.  Servicing is also hugely cheaper.

That said - the environmental benefits are massively overblown.  I personally think the main benefit is relocating the source of the pollution away from urban centres (even if quite a bit of the sourcing is from coal plants), but beyond that, many of the environmental evils remain - [as an example, tyres are a major contributor to ocean microplastics](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/jul/14/car-tyres-are-major-source-of-ocean-microplastics-study).

"It'll always be a Miata if it's lightweight, RWD, 50/50 weight distro and affordable. IDGAF about the drivetrain.

The NA and NB uses a N/A version of a turbo'd version of a N/A engine from the 323. The NC uses a Ford engine and the ND1 straightup dropped the regular ass Mazda 3 2.0 motor in before the tune-up arrived with the ND2. Yet not that many people complained about their drivetrain. The Miata is supposed to be a homage to the British roadsters of old, and almost all of them used a souped up family car 4/6cyl powertrain. In the near future (2025+), the said souped up family car powertrain will be a 200hp electric motor.

If Mazda really wants to have some fun with an EV, here's an idea I have while drunk. Give it a gated H shifter and a third pedal. The shifter goes from 1-6 and it determines how much regen it has. From 1 (one pedal driving) to 6 (almost nothing). Give it a reverse too. The third pedal gently erases the regen in all gears. You just got yourself a way to fine tune regen (that's basically engine braking) while driving up the engagement-o-meter.","<div class=""md""><p>It&#39;ll always be a Miata if it&#39;s lightweight, RWD, 50/50 weight distro and affordable.

I see this as more of a GM decision than a mutual one. With them delaying their EV plans, making the battery plants apart unionized in their UAW contract (whenever they come to an agreement,) costs are rising. They don’t have a solution to getting costs down in terms of electrification, the affordable EV plans are scrapped. 

As far as Honda goes, it’s going to be interesting to see how they ride this out as they rely heavily on more affordable cars. I can see a Nissan and Honda collaboration in China and North America benefiting both companies as they are similar sizes, have presence in these markets and have resources to help and benefit one another! 

Btw, Reuters article on this is much better!

"Similar story? Maybe...

In 1990, there was a black Corvette ZR1 running around the suburbs of Detroit, Michigan. It had unusually large NACA ducts on top of the front fenders. It also wore a manufacturer's license plate. I had my camera, so I followed it into the parking lot of business, where the driver parked it. I got out, walked up to it and studied it a bit. 

It occurred to me that this was likely just a test mule for a more effective cooling system. This generation of ZR1 had cooling issues. I took out my pocket camera and snapped a few pictures of the front of the car...pictures I still have. 

Out came the driver in full sprint, barking like a middle school assistant principal. ""Put that god damned camera down!"" I was honestly afraid he would tackle me, like I was some wild paparazzi. He was wearing the black ""Member's Only"" jacket with his name emblazoned on it, and the words ""Corvette Engineering"" embroidered on it. I'll only identify him as JM, and only because he was a huge asshole.

He demanded I give him the film, as any evidence of this very special car (it wasn't) being on the road would be a career ender for him. He stood at my toes, pearls of spittle flying from his mouth as tried to scare me.

I put the camera in my pocket, hiding the fact that I was admittedly shaken, and calmly told him that if he didn't want the car photographed, he should haven't taken it from the proving grounds. He followed me to my car, making threats.

Nothing ever came of this, and things like this didn't deter GM from testing development mules on public roads.  ","<div class=""md""><p>Similar story? Maybe...</p>

The energy companies have made it clear that they aren't interested in paying up to build out the infrastructure.

So it's up to the taxpayer. Which means it won't happen anytime soon. It just **won't.**

Building the infrastructure is too expensive to be palatable politically - even with a blue majority in Congress we couldn't pass BBB (which included investment in electrification - even without the need for bipartisan support the bill still failed because its seen as too expensive).

"This is great. I’ve long believed that it would make great sense for GM to launch a performance sub-brand under the Corvette name. It could offer similar vehicle types to Porsche (sports car, sports sedan, compact suv, midsize suv), but it wouldn’t really compete head-to-head with Porsche, because Corvette can reach a completely different market segment that Porsche can hardly access. 

Basically, there is a chunk of the market that isn’t going to buy Porsche, BMW or the other German luxury brands, and are even adverse to Cadillac or Lincoln, because they don’t want to appear “snobby”. But they will pay premium prices for something that comes with an “Everyman” nameplate. 

These are basically the people buying 90k pickup trucks and Denali-trim GMCs. They have the money but will only use it in ways that they believe are “non-flashy”.

While pickups have become giant luxo-barges, some folks still use them for pulling campers and skid steers, that's what the whole ""truck"" thing is supposed to be about.  With 8000lbs behind it, that battery won't last long without some supplemental power.    That robs the truck of it's ""truckyness"" in an electric only version.

 Look at cars with half a million miles on them, they are mostly pickups.   People drive the snot out of these things, some distance.   Hybrid is the way.  Use the road to interface the two, and get 4x4.   

Most 4x4 is for snow covered roads.  Rock crawling would probably be better done all electric, for the massive torque and being able to angle the motors, but one shouldn't design around such a small niche.

Small gas/big electric hybrid isn't often seen mainly ""range extender"" in the BMW i3, and it might take some adjustment to realize you can't go 70mph up a mountain pulling a fifth wheel without charging, so either go 45mph that the gas can do, or accept the range limitation.    

For the rest of the time, charging in your garage (do apt dwellers need a pickup anyway?)  you can make it from burb A to burb B to pay for the thing on an every day basis without having to stop at the gas station.

An all electric truck is too much, too soon, and this thing may flop.

"There's 2 big problems in central Europe:

1. Many people see EVs as a political statement. Most right-wing people I (unfortunately) know would never touch them because it's for the cOmMuNiStS.
2. If you can't charge at home or work (which probably is true for at least 25% of the population) owning an EV can be a very miserable experience. Instead of saving hours per year by charging at home you're now turning every ""refill"" into a 30 minute operation.

So I agree that all-electric will be hard to manage. Maybe if we get into the 1000+km range for those 25% of people.

And generally speaking: Having reliable public transit so people don't need a car would be much better. But at least in Germany, I don't see that coming anytime soon.","<div class=""md""><p>There&#39;s 2 big problems in central Europe:</p>

"**Summary:**

* Rivian has revealed the R3 and RX3 that will enter the company's lineup in the next few years, likely as 2027 models.
* The subcompact Rivian R3 shares a platform with the R2 model that was also revealed today, but its wheelbase is five inches shorter.
* The Rivian R3X is sportier and geared more towards adventure than the regular R3, with three electric motors, wider wheels and tires, and higher ground clearance.

**TLDR:** Electric hot hatch goes brrr.","<div class=""md""><p><strong>Summary:</strong></p>

"This is likely less ""my next EV has to be a Toyota"" and more ""I want Toyota values in an EV"".

At the end of the day, people know what they're getting with a Toyota - it's dependable, affordable, inoffensive transport for the most part. 

Like it or not, that sentiment covers a very large portion of car buyers. 

EV's *should* have the first one of those attributes nailed down, but there's always going to be reliability issues with an immature product. With standardisation and more capability in critical requirements (ie. not whether the car is bulletproof or can float, but whether the seats are comfortable, the boot is practical and it has the features people want) that will resolve itself, but it takes time to mature a product, particularly on a 5-7 year generational cycle.

The second attribute isn't there yet either; we've still got premium and luxury manufacturers building cheaper ICE vehicles than their equivalent EVs, so it'll take time to get there - and as long as they're not yet affordable out of the gate, the gap will be even wider at the affordable end of the market, and again that'll take time.

The last one is a function of affordability - if you can't compete on something affordable, you need to add bells and whistles and make it look starkly different to advertise that it's an EV - otherwise it's just an expensive Golf or Sonata with less features.

The biggest thing this does though, is point out in stark relief the disconnect between the EV community and the community at large - at the end of the day, all the spreadsheets in the world won't sway someone who just wants something that meets those needs.","<div class=""md""><p>This is likely less &quot;my next EV has to be a Toyota&quot; and more &quot;I want Toyota values in an EV&quot;.</p>

But here in the Midwest, you can't go on normal road trips without seriously calculating your stops. And electric tech isn't as stable as gas or hybrid propulsion. Say you're driving though west Kansas in late fall and there's a sudden winter storm. You lose 20% of your range due to the temp drop and none of these rural gas stations have chargers. Also, in the Midwest everyone drives an SUV or truck. Not a tiny sedan. So the range on these is low right from the start. The F-150 Lightnings and E-Transit have a very small customer base. Someone who never wants to leave their home city with the vehicle. So you're only catering to small business and delivery services, rather than the entire market. 

Right now, for most of the country, hybrid makes a lot more sense. Once you start seeing gas stations everywhere have at least 2 chargers, we are there. Until then, all electric motorways in the US is a pipe dream.","<div class=""md""><p>Electric just isn&#39;t there yet in most of the US.

"> Here, on the basis of results from five questionnaire surveys, we find that PEV discontinuance in California occurs at a rate of 20% for plug-in hybrid electric vehicle owners and 18% for battery electric vehicle owners. We show that **discontinuance is related to dissatisfaction with the convenience of charging, having other vehicles in the household that are less efficient, not having level 2 (240-volt) charging at home, having fewer household vehicles and not being male.**

Thought a quote directly from the study's abstract would shed more light than the Yahoo/Business Insider headline. It's NOT a full 20% of EV owners that switch to gas because of charging hassle... 20% of EV owners don't buy another EV and there are **5 total factors including charging hassle.**

"The Mach-E looks interesting. However after watching a few road trip videos where the guy had nothing but problems charging at EA stations infuriated me. Hell if I’m going to drop $40k + on an EV and babysit the car to charge it, or fiddle around for 20 minutes to get it to work.

The software in the Mach-E is also a turn off from what I’ve been seeing. 

I came out of my week worth of Intel off watching real time videos on road trips across the country in EV’s:

1) Don’t buy a non Tesla
2) Don’t road trip in a non Tesla 

Mostly every charger that’s not a Tesla charged at <30 Kw on the east coast, half the stations were not functioning, and others wouldn’t initiate the handshake.

The charging infrastructure that’s not Tesla sucks and isn’t very stable. That sucks, because EA is everywhere. They just need to solidify the software and get the bugs worked out.

I would own a 2nd gen Mach-E GT, or even be more confident with a MS or M3.

In due time I guess.

Tesla’s entire logistics of charging and charging infrastructure was such a breeze and relaxing thing to watch. 

Tbh, I’m also considering buying a bolt EV for putting around town to save mileage on my ICE car. At $200 or around that per month for used or leasing new, they’re practically giving these cars  away with these incentives.

Then I was put off by the cost of running a 240v line to the garage to charge instead of the 120 that’s in there. I wfh, but still, 4 miles per hour or whatever the measurement is won’t cut out.

Would be nice though to not have to worry about gas, oil, spark plugs and/or components going bad and still have my ICE car to tinker and run a muck on the weekends.","<div class=""md""><p>The Mach-E looks interesting.

Hell if I’m going to drop $40k + on an EV and babysit the car to charge it, or fiddle around for 20 minutes to get it to work.</p>

<p>The software in the Mach-E is also a turn off from what I’ve been seeing. </p>

<p>I came out of my week worth of Intel off watching real time videos on road trips across the country in EV’s:</p>

<p>1) Don’t buy a non Tesla
2) Don’t road trip in a non Tesla </p>

<p>Mostly every charger that’s not a Tesla charged at &lt;30 Kw on the east coast, half the stations were not functioning, and others wouldn’t initiate the handshake.</p>

<p>The charging infrastructure that’s not Tesla sucks and isn’t very stable. That sucks, because EA is everywhere. They just need to solidify the software and get the bugs worked out.</p>

<p>I would own a 2nd gen Mach-E GT, or even be more confident with a MS or M3.</p>

<p>In due time I guess.</p>

<p>Tesla’s entire logistics of charging and charging infrastructure was such a breeze and relaxing thing to watch. </p>

<p>Tbh, I’m also considering buying a bolt EV for putting around town to save mileage on my ICE car. At $200 or around that per month for used or leasing new, they’re practically giving these cars  away with these incentives.</p>

<p>Then I was put off by the cost of running a 240v line to the garage to charge instead of the 120 that’s in there. I wfh, but still, 4 miles per hour or whatever the measurement is won’t cut out.</p>

<p>Would be nice though to not have to worry about gas, oil, spark plugs and/or components going bad and still have my ICE car to tinker and run a muck on the weekends.</p>

"We’re ok financially, but can’t really afford new cars.  I mean, base trim for the mid-tier newer vehicles that are discussed here start MSRP at over $30K. Add anything decent to the overall package and it’s instantly $40k without dealing with any markups by whoever is selling it.  Sure, you can buy a sub-$20k car new, but that’s not what people like discussing here, and EV’s are generally being sold as a “premium” item these days. I think the cheapest EV is the Bolt with sub-300 mile range and no frills for ~$28k, and prices go up quickly from there. 

We bought my other half’s car with several upgrades (better audio, heated seats, etc) and the better engine package for a little under $30k out the door a decade ago.  That’s starting price for the same car but lowest trim/base model today.

No way.

Used EVs like a Nissan Leaf are absolutely affordable. Pre-Covid they were easily under 10k, and that’s a much more affordable price than the 40k average price of a new vehicle or the damn near 100k price of the model S or top trim lighting.

"That is true and it sucks for them.  But if you *do* have money for a new car, here's some financial comparison math for you:

I just bought a Kia EV6 Wind RWD with some nice tech and driver comfort features in it.  Got the extended warranty on it, but otherwise paid sticker (plus fees, delivery, and taxes) for it.  Came out to about $55,000.

I figure a top-end Kia Sportage (the X-Pro Prestige), which is a car from the same manufacturer, roughly similar in size and function, and with probably as close to the same tech and comfort features as my EV6 has, would come out to about $43,000 after you give an honest nod to an extended warranty, fees, delivery, and taxes on it, too.

That's a $12,000 ""premium"" that I paid to get the electric car over a fairly equivalent ICE car.

The EV6 Wind RWD can achieve an average of 4.0 mi./kWh pretty comfortably in mixed use driving--it's what I've been getting with it.

The Kia Sportage X-Pro Prestige gets 23 MPG city / 28 highway.  We'll call it 26 MPG combined.

The average price of a gallon of regular gas in my state right now is $4.38.  I know my own personal electric bill comes out to $0.174/kWh after you add up all the different parts of my utility bill that charge per kWh used.

The EV6 Wind RWD therefore costs: ($0.174/kWh) / (4.0 mi./kWh) = $0.0435/mi. to drive just based on electricity costs alone.

The Sportage X-Pro Prestige costs: ($4.38/gal) / (26 mi./gal) = $0.168/mi. to drive just based on gas price alone.

That's a difference of $0.1245 *saved* per mile driving the Kia EV6 Wind RWD instead of the Sportage X-Pro Prestige.

Going back to the $12,000 ""premium"" you spend on the EV6 instead of the Sportage in this hypothetical scenario, it takes 96,386 miles of driving to make up that price premium.  I put on 19,000 miles per year, so that's about 5 years of driving for me to recoup that price premium.

But note that I only took account of ""fueling"" costs in this comparison.  Once you consider that electric cars don't need oil or oil filter changes, spark plugs, ATF, engine air filters, or fuel additives/injector cleaners, you find that you are actually saving a few additional cents per mile based on maintenance savings.  Yes, EVs do have coolant in them, but coolant only gets changed out over such a long interval (not to mention that it also obviously exists in ICE vehicles), that it barely contributes at all to your cost of maintenance that builds on a per-mile basis.  Also, EVs have tires and brakes that wear out over time, too, but these two items work in opposing directions: brakes are cheaper on an EV because they hardly ever get used in most models.  On the other hand, tires are more expensive and wear out faster on an EV, but even if you were almost mustache twirling villain-level disingenuous about the true cost difference between ICE vs EV tires and the difference in replacement intervals, it only shrinks the gap between them by, again, a few cents per mile--serving to ultimately, at the worst, wash out the extra few cents per mile saved on what could have been engine maintenance.  And so it's not enough to change the fact that the electric car costs a lot less to drive per mile than the gas car does.","<div class=""md""><p>That is true and it sucks for them.

"The two big things preventing most people from buying an EV are initial cost of the car and range anxiety. I don't know how to fix the cost issue other than time but the range anxiety thing is going to require serious investment in public charging infrastructure.

"Yeah.  Toyota seems to be the most reluctant of all auto makers to push for electric cars.  

They were the main driver behind the mainstream adaptation of hybrids, but they certainly don’t seem very eager to give up this market advantage.  

It seems that they have been trying to confuse the market with their various “hydrogen” products while dragging their feet on EV.  

I mean, strategically it makes sense since the first kinds of vehicles to get cannibalised are priuses and such.  

I get that they are THE biggest manufacturer and that they have massive factories that are geared for internal combustion engine production, and that these costs still need to be amortised over decades still, but dragging their feet only means that they are giving big openings to their competitors.

I KNOW that cheap Chinese motors, batteries and controllers, if not complete vehicles, will absolutely decimate the slow-footed companies.  But I don’t get why every established player isn’t busting their asses to get in front of this inevitable transition to EV and be seen as a historical leader with a history of dependability and a demonstrated ability to support and service their cars.

To me, I am hesitant to buy an EV because it is likely to be a 10-year-long commitment to whatever vehicle I buy, and I am not interested in being a bet tester for some unknown brand or a company that has demonstrated that they look at their customers more like how electronics companies look at their customers (planned obsolescence, etc. Tesla).

If anything I would say that Apple has demonstrated that treating your products with a more long-term ownership mindset creates a kind of loyal customer base that is willing to pay a premium for this.

I mean, If I drop $3,000 for a laptop, I can keep it for 7 years plus or sell it after a couple of years  and recover enough money to buy the current one (like you might do with a car).  Can you do that if you spent $3,000 on a gaming laptop or even a Dell/HP?","<div class=""md""><p>Yeah.  Toyota seems to be the most reluctant of all auto makers to push for electric cars.  </p>

"I don't get it. I never will.

This weighs about 180lbs less than six Lotus Elan S1s.

About 600lbs less than three E36 M3s.

About 900lbs more than two E39 M5s.

About equal to three four-door E30 325is.

It weighs the same as my turbodiesel Colorado ZR2 Bison (with full skid plate package and winch) with a new M3 (non-xDrive) in the bed.

It's about 120lbs ~~more~~ less than three 911 S/Ts.

I just pulled up the 1994 Car and Driver Luxury SUV Comparison test. The weights were:

Explorer: 4,435lbs

Trooper: 4,485lbs

Montero: 4,742lbs

Range Rover: 4,568lbs

Land Cruiser: 5,153lbs

Grand Cherokee: 4,101lbs

That means this Escalade IQ weighs more than a Grand Cherokee V8 with a Mitsubishi Montero strapped to the roof.

"The whole ""turbo name argument"" call out was a little ridiculous. Doug made it seem like it was the most immature, baseless argument he's ever heard of.

"Not surprising as it’s actually a minivan styled as an SUV - the high floor is just the battery as opposed to ground clearance. Low CoE should mean less rolls though, which is always good for safety.  

Once we get true SUV roaders they should be more stable as the weight is lower and more evenly distributed, but we’ll have to wait and see how low you can get the CoE on an actual off road vehicle as more manufacturers come to EV in the next couple of years. As I understand it the two main problems are that SUV’s that can mud need to be strong, which means heavy, and they have to have off road range (for berries and twigs don’t easily fit in batteries) which is much more energy demanding than road use. Not a major problem for the Tesla X as you’re not going to take it off road, but with gas bans starting to appear globally, it’s gonna be a factor for all the proper SUV’s - I suspect some of them may have to do what Land Rover did with the defender and reclassify it as a commercial vehicle to buy themselves an extra couple of years.

Still nice to know it doesn’t roll if you corner too hard and end up in the sand trap - Tesla X racing leagues here we come!

"I love that they're leaning forward here and helping create an aftermarket for EV tech. 

That said, I don't see how this specific product solves anything. Because it's transverse, it's either limited to FWD or RWD (or AWD I guess, x2), which means whatever you're swapping it into needs to have been an independent suspension setup to begin with. So forget a straightforward swap into almost any muscle car. Converting a live axle car to an independent setup requires a ton of fab or a kit, and those cost more than this motor.

And all of this completely ignores the elephant in the room, which is the lack of modular batteries. Most modern EV's use battery trays that occupy the area under the floor boards. Most non-EV cars are not designed to accommodate this without major reconstruction.

If Ford wants to deliver a true ""crate motor"" experience to custom builders, they should build a live axle motor with the same dimensions and packaging as a common 8.8"" or 9"" rear axle, and assemble a battery pack that fits in the same space as a small block V8.

"This is a very competitive price for an electrive drive unit. It even undercuts the prices of used Tesla drive units.

But the headlines are a bit misleading because that $3,900 is still FAR from a complete EV setup. This motor includes a ""traction inverter harness"", but an inverter is NOT included (or even available from Ford Performance), nor are the batteries - which are the most expensive part of any EV build.

An inverter for this power level costs around $2,000-$3,000 and the readily available battery modules I could find come in between $260 to $315 per kWh. The best value I could find was on a used Model 3 50kWh pack at $10,000.

So if you want to build a complete EV powertrain, you are still looking at around $16,500 before you add in the miscellaneous integration parts.

Hydrogen fuel has too many problems that are fundamental to the physical chemistry of hydrogen as an element.

The issue isn&#39;t we can&#39;t do it technology wise, it&#39;s infringing on the political and capitalistic mentality of dinosaur governing people who could give a shit.</p>

I heard about a synthetic leaf (a silicon layer bathed in pure water that performs electrolysis when exposed to sunlight). This would create the needed O2 and H2 to supply a fuel cell.

<p>Either way, driving something small and convertible without noise, (tailpipe) emissions or annoying torque interruptions has huge appeal to me. I want to put the roof down on a nice day and silently zip up and down the local canyons with that nice, &quot;direct torque&quot; feeling EVs have in a small two-seater. A car like that would be a hoot at autocrosses too!</p>

"It would be cool but I don't believe we're going to see one anytime soon that will be affordable.

The first Tesla roadster was essentially a Lotus Elise with batteries instead of a 2ZZGE. 
AT THE TIME it performed well but was still overweight and didn't have a large battery. It also had a ton of quirks and currently doesn't work with superchargers.

What I would be more interested in would be a lighter weight sports sedan think Model3 Performance with less weight, less gimmicks, a regular speedometer, and double wish-bone suspension. Similar to the Porsche Taycon's 2 speed transmission They could use a less powerful motor if they use a more aggressive 1st gear that goes 1st to 72 then swaps to the higher gear for better range. 

Similar to Pontiac with the Fiero or Chevy with the Corvette It would be really cool if they could just do the plastic composite style body panels to save on cost which with the skateboard battery pack system would allow for a modular style vehicle.

"Porsche is our best hope right now. Their prototype electric Cayman I think weighed about 500lbs more than the combustion engine GT4.

A compromise is a heavier AWD electric coupe with four-wheel steering, like what the Nissan GT-R and AMG GT-R have. Four wheel steering offsets some of the understeer caused by heavier AWD cars. 

Another thing that can improve cornering speed with heavier cars is downforce features on the chassis. The 992 GT3 RS generates 2/3 of its weight in downforce which is why it’s so much faster than cars with more power. These features are quite expensive today, but partly because they’re rare/non-standardized. So if we standardize vents, diffusers, and rear wings, maybe production costs will be better. The drawback to more downforce is your battery range.

The problem with high instant torque on RWD is wheel spin at lower speeds, so a traction control system would be artificially bottlenecking your available torque. AWD gets you faster off a standing start/slow speeds and better mid-corner traction on throttle input, but the drawback is it’s a bit heavier with more understeer.","<div class=""md""><p>Porsche is our best hope right now.
