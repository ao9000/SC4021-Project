I get a job 2 miles from home. What do I need? I need an EV. Two miles to work will kill my ICE truck that is 20 years old. By now the Bolt has been on the market for 3 years.

It’s really a battery on wheels GM’s past be damned. 3) The utter and complete disregard for the consumer. Guess what I have not one, but two level 2 charging stations. (I know I am spoiled, 1 is a detached garage). Neither of these will work outside. The cable doesn’t reach that far! 4) The 20 year old truck I dispensed of and replaced with the Bolt HAD NOTHING WRONG WITH IT. It was a Toyota’s second year of production for the first gen Tundra.

It would be even higher without the tint; since having mine installed, I'm finding that I'm just as comfortable with the AC on auto at anywhere from 2-5°F higher than in my Tahoe. Sport Mode is fun. Especially to turn on while accelerating onto the freeway :) I don't have Super Cruise, but ACC is amazing on freeways, especially in heavy traffic. It's also quite smart about using regenerative braking, as is at least as efficient as I am on manual. One pedal driving is similarly amazing, but only in town (and other stop-and-go situations--not freeway-style slow-and-go). Works exactly like compression braking on a manual transmission. Paired with the regen-on-demand paddle, you don't ever need the brake pedal after a bit of practice.

645,"You might already be aware of this, but in case you're not, with reference to your point number 7: EV batteries have a charge curve based on their current state of charge. The closer it is to full, the slower it is able to accept additional charge. When you use a route planner, it will usually try to get you as close to minimum SoC as it can when picking the next charging station, and then have you move on before you get to full charge, because you can go from 10% to 60% a lot faster than you can go from 40% to 90%. If some of your stops were just to top off, you might already have had a high enough SoC that you were down the charge curve to 38-42 kW. By the way, you are a braver Bolt owner than I am.

We're mid-way through our third set of tires -- Michelin CrossClimate 2 (highly recommended). We are on our second windshield -- a rock jumped up and cracked it fairly early in its life. The only minor issue that we've had is that the BSM LED on our driver-side mirror has been out for quite some time. I asked about getting it replaced when I went in for the battery swap, and they said it would be about $300 and they would call me when the part comes in. I ""tested"" it once, and the car beeped and counter-steered -- so the sensors work fine. The dealership never called me back about the mirror. My two cents... avoid Sport Chevrolet in Silver Spring, MD -- they also had me waiting two hours for a loaner car because they weren't paying their Enterprise Rent-A-Car bills and I arrived on the morning that Enterprise decided to cut them off. Enterprise called me and apprised me of the situation. I had to go to the service manager and tell them to pay their friggen bills. That left me waiting about two hours for office workers to arrive so they could slap new plates on a car to make it a loaner, and that made me late for work.

795,"I'm glad to see this thread. I've recently been looking into getting an EV and charging speed has been one of the big points in which ones I'm considering. Hopefully people here can help since I have some questions. I've been mostly looking at a Bolt or Kia EV6. My electric car experience is limited, but a few years ago a friend borrowed a Tesla and we took our families from central California, where we live, to the Grand Canyon and Vegas. Pretty long trip and at that time there weren't nearly as many charging stations as I see today. Anyway, if I got an EV, a vast majority of the time it would be around town driving and charging at home. Actually, my wife would be the one driving it since I usually bike to work. About once a month though we go to LA or SF which is about 200-250 miles, we live right smack in the middle of California. Some of those miles to the cities are going to be in the mountains too. I'm curious how long it would take to charge and how many stops we would have to make in the Bolt vs the Kia. I've read a lot of people talking about the Bolt being slow at fast charging and the Kia/Hyundai being very fast but honestly, how much of a difference is it? I prefer smaller cars, and I like the way the Bolt looks and it's like 15k cheaper and they give you the L2 charger for your house. These are all big plusses in my book. My wife, however, likes nicer things and the Kia is bigger with the better interior quality it seems. Personally, in everything but claimed charging speed, I prefer the Bolt but we haven't actually been in either. I can't exactly go test drive these cars since none exist around here and everyone I know who has an EV drives a Tesla and their charging situation is it's own thing so they can't really help, they just say buy a Tesla, which I'm not interested in doing. It would be a hard sell to my wife if every time we visit family or go to Disneyland or something we're at a charging station for an hour while other cars come and go or if the difference is really that big. Anyway, if anyone can help I would appreciate it. It's hard getting a decent idea just watching youtube videos.",6,0.008605719,0.14234884,0.84904546,positive,1,0,,1,0,,positive,positive

854,"This summer was a wild ride for my Bolt EV. It's my 2nd year autocrossing with it, and 1st year entering it into the STH class, a subclass of ""Class 3"" in the SCCNH series. At the first weekend of the season, I didn't have my coilovers, so the only mods to the car were the wheels + tires, rear sway bar, and brake pads + fluid. Still, managed to finish 4th and 3rd that weekend, not bad! The second weekend of the season I managed to have my coilovers installed, and that made a huge difference! The car really picked up a bit of pace, especially through slaloms. No understeer either, if anything the car oversteers a bit. Picked up 2nd on Saturday, and 1st on Sunday! Hence the gold medal in the last photo! Needless to say, I was thrilled. The final weekend of the series I managed to get the car dialed in quite well, but faced some of the stiffest competition all year, a 370Z and a BRZ were both in contention of taking the win, the points were so close. I ended up taking 3rd and 2nd, enough to tie me with the BRZ for the season, and just eek ahead of the 370Z! What a thrilling result this season.

1137,"I feel for you, your wife and your Bolt. My prayers are that she gets the proper medical care and heals fast. I had a similar situation in April 2023. My 2017 Bolt was rear ended by Speed Racer driving a Jetta at 70MPH. I was stopped waiting to make a right turn. He was attemptig to pass a slower moving vehicle in the center of three lanes by passing on the inside. He didn't look and I was there. My Bolt did a 180 and the rear was more or less all over the road. My recommendation is to really dig into the valuation that the third-party adjuster will make. Look at every line and every feature on every comp. Don't let them get away with saing that your Bolt was in fair or good condition. Mine was in excelltnt and I had interior and exterior pictures to prove it. Take them. Many mistakes were initially made in every feature that my Bolt had (Premium fully loaded) vs comparable vehcicles. I had to argue for every one and correct mistakes. Don't accept the first version of the report. Keep pushing and get your insurance company involved. They will assist you. Be sure to get credit for sales tax, tire condition, unexpired registration and anything else. It all adds up to your vehicle value at the time of the collision. Look into your insurance policy if there is any risk of under insurance in the at fault party. My insurance had to initially cover the loss and then seek subogration against the other party insurance. I found out that my policy had a 20% bonus to the settled value for a totaled vehicle. The at fault insurance company would have never had that. You are going to get screwed by the recent decline in selling price. With all of the used Bolts on the marked from GM buybacks and Hertz dumping their inventory, the price has plumeted. In April 2023 the price was much higher. I ended up settling for just about my initial 2017 purchase price net of federal tax credit and state rebate. This covered the purchase of our 2023 EUV Premier net of federal tax credit and state rebate. Good luck. If you want to send me a message, I will be happy to have a conversation.
