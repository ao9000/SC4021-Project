"I do 60 miles a day 5 days a week and obviously use it to anywhere outside of work because it’s so cheap to run, I also charge at work for free. In my old Kia Soul EV I had a 20k a year contract and was going to burn past the 60k over 3 years until the pandemic last March and lockdown saved me so much in excess mileage charges. My new car is an MG MG5 on 25k a year over 4 years and that’s £338 a month with no initial lease. It’s quoted range is 213 miles but with motorway driving at 70mph I am fine if this is reduced to 180 as that is still plenty to get to the mother in law’s and back without charging. Now my life story is over, I looked at all those cars and with the government grant reducing to £2.5k in March, the prices all went up and the price sky rockets on a lease over 15-20k miles a year. The quoted prices on all the websites is usually 8k miles a year, I could not find a Kona, ID3 or my preferred eNiro for the price of the MG. If you have £2k initial rental to put down then it might be affordable but that initial cost and a monthly of £350 will cost a lot over 3-4 years. The effective monthly would be about £400 over the course of the lease. I wanted a bigger boot hence why I looked at the eNiro/Kona, and settled on the MG5 because it’s an estate. The roof rails on the Exclusive are decorative only, despite initial MG pictures from the company themselves showing roof boxes and bike racks on the bars, since airbrushed out - so I don’t know what ownership is going to be like at this point. You probably got your Leaf at a similar time to my Soul, back in 2017/18 when there were huge discounts from the only 2 electric cars around. Those discounts are gone so my monthly on the Soul was £250 for 20k a year, unbelievable price for that mileage. Mechanically absolutely nothing went wrong with the car apart from the 12v battery had to be replaced. That was a reliable Kia though, again no idea what the MG will be like, but with so few moving parts I don’t bother with a maintenance contract as that adds such a premium to the monthly price.

"The short answer today is, no. Nissan leafs' are starting to get aftermarket battery replacements but they had an issue with not actively cooling their batteries so a bigger market opened for such things. However, there will be a lot of cars like this in the future with limited range so it's entirely possible these aftermarket services may exist, but I'd assume they won't be available when making purchasing decisions.",5,0.19279805,0.7490481,0.058153845,neutral
You won’t need to upgrade it so don’t worry,2,0.06467273,0.6382255,0.2971018,neutral
"We don't really know. Realistically you might be able to get it replaced in 15-20 years to breathe fresh life into the cars range. Or like in the case of some old Kia Soul EVs just replacing a couple of modules (costs a few hundred bucks, got most range back) EVs are designed with certain sized battery packs, weighing X kilos etc. So any ""upgrade"" or otherwise replacement has to play well with those specifications. But again we just don't know. No EV's of modern design have been around for so long, except leaf. And those early tesla owners from back in the day are probably rich enough to buy a new car every few years.",2,0.14298841,0.7602906,0.09672091,neutral
"The simple, but unpopular answer, is sell the leaf and buy an economical petrol car. If you can't charge at home and can't reliably find any other charger, there is no other solution :-(",0,0.8199644,0.1683828,0.011652832,negative
Your best bet is to contact the councils. If you need to I'm sure you could do a FOI request. Mine do not have anywhere near enough!,1,0.38166046,0.53782225,0.08051725,neutral
