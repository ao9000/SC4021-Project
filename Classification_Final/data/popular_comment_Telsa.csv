"> Musk, however, has insisted that Tesla's cars only use optical sensors, likening it to how humans primarily use their eyes to drive This right here shows just how UNintelegent, and two-dimensional, fElon's thinking is. It reads like something said by someone who doesn't fully understand how driving works. Don't forget Humans do not rely on vision alone to drive. We use stereoscopic vision, hearing, proprioception (sense of where our body and limbs are in space, extending to the body of the car itself), our vestibular sense (Sense of balance/orientation), and our somatosensory system (sense of touch) all in concert to control a vehicle. On the computational side we also have object permanence and nearly instantaneous extrapolation from limited datasets (Think being able to tell what a sign is even if it's mostly obscured, or knowing where a car went when you saw it for a half second before it went behind a truck), not to mention our ability to, on an unconscious level, anticipate the actions of other drivers and pedestrians on the road. Driving is not a simple task, and no limited-scope AI system that is possible with the technology we have today, and that will fit neatly into a car, will be able to handle it as well as a human. The only people who think otherwise watched too much Knight Rider in the 80's. (Which I can definitely imaging fElon doing) That's not to say we won't get there eventually, Wamo, Cruze, Aurora, and the other companies working on SDCs are getting there, but we aren't there yet.",26,0.4507098,0.5215654,0.027724847,neutral,,,,,,

"""He has taken illegal drugs with current SpaceX and former Tesla board member Steve Jurvetson…**Illegal drug use would likely be a violation of federal policies that could jeopardize SpaceX’s billions of dollars in government contracts. Musk is intrinsic to the value of his companies, potentially putting at risk around $1 trillion in assets held by investors, tens of thousands of jobs and big parts of the U.S. space program**…Then in 2018, people familiar with Musk’s behavior said, another incident seemed to mark a turning point for him—and showed that his drug use could have consequences for his businesses. That year, Musk got into trouble with NASA for smoking marijuana on the Joe Rogan show, raising red flags for some about the business impact of Musk’s conduct and causing employees at SpaceX to be randomly tested for drugs…In addition to violating federal contracts, any kind of illegal drug use would break company policies at both SpaceX and Tesla, and would raise questions about Musk’s executive role at the publicly traded Tesla, where the board has a duty to shareholders to oversee management…Some Tesla board members over the years have talked among themselves about their concerns over Musk’s alleged drug use but haven’t said anything formally that would end up as an official board agenda item or in meeting minutes, people familiar with the discussions said…In the Isaacson book, Musk is quoted as saying, “I really don’t like doing illegal drugs”…**Illegal drug use by employees is also in violation of the rules that govern the more than $14 billion in contracts that Musk’s private rocket company, SpaceX, has with the U.S. government for civilian and military space missions. Federal contracts require that companies comply with the Drug-Free Workplace Act and foster a drug-free culture with programs and policies, regardless of any state laws that may legalize some usage. Contractors can also lose security clearances because of drug abuse, defined as the use of illegal drugs or prescription medications “in a manner that deviates from approved medical direction.” In his role as CEO and founder of SpaceX, Musk has a security clearance that gives him access to classified information.**…Behind the scenes, things were much more dire: Musk had been under the influence as he answered the reporters’ questions, according to people briefed on the episode. The CEO hadn’t informed Tesla’s communications team that he was giving the interview, people familiar with the episode said…**Soon after, Musk smoked marijuana on the comedian Rogan’s show, which can be streamed online. NASA demanded written assurances that SpaceX was complying with the federal drug-free workplace law and spent $5 million in taxpayer dollars on training for SpaceX employees, according to a letter NASA sent to the company and federal contracting records**…Corporate contractors must follow standard NASA guidelines for drug tests that usually check for marijuana and cocaine and have the ability to also test for amphetamines, opiates and PCP.

">The files contain over 1,000 accident reports involving phantom braking or unintended acceleration--mostly in the U.S. and Germany. >A German news outlet sifted through over 23,000 of Tesla’s internal files and found a disturbing trend of brushing off customers complaining about dangerous Autopilot glitches while covering the company’s ass. >The Tesla files contain more than 2,400 self-acceleration complaints and more than 1,500 braking function problems, including 139 cases of unintentional emergency braking and 383 reported phantom stops resulting from false collision warnings. The number of crashes is more than 1000. A table of incidents involving driver assistance systems where customers have expressed safety concerns has more than 3000 entries. >The oldest complaints available to the Handelsblatt date from 2015, the most recent from March 2022. During this period, Tesla delivered around 2.6 million vehicles with the autopilot software. Most of the incidents took place in the US , but there are also complaints from Europe and Asia in the documents - including many from German Tesla drivers. >The Handelsblatt contacted dozens of customers from several countries. All confirmed the information from the Tesla files. In discussions, they gave insights into their experiences with the autopilot. Some disclosed their communication with the US automaker, others showed Handelsblatt reporters videos of the accident.﻿ >How did the company deal with complaints? The Tesla files also provide information about this. The files show that employees have precise guidelines for communicating with customers. The top priority is obviously: offer as little attack surface as possible. >__For each incident there are bullet points for the “technical review”. The employees who enter this review into the system regularly make it clear that the report is “for internal use only”. Each entry also contains a note in bold type that information, if at all, may only be passed on “VERBALLY to the customer”.__ >__“Do not copy and paste the report below into an email, text message, or leave it in a voicemail to the customer,” it said. Vehicle data should also not be released without permission. If, despite the advice, “an involvement of a lawyer cannot be prevented”, this must be recorded.__ >__Customers that Handelsblatt spoke to have the impression that Tesla employees avoid written communication. “They never sent emails, everything was always verbal,” says the doctor from California, whose Tesla said it accelerated on its own in the fall of 2021 and crashed into two concrete pillars.﻿__ - Looks like they aren't reporting most of these incidents to NHTSA, something that __should__ (probably won't) be a huge crime. Tesla built a system where everything is internal to them, they have complete control over everything and a backdoor to everything.

Our preliminary investigation indicates a Toyota Corolla was traveling south on SR-35 southbound, south of Page Mill Road, at an unknown speed, when the driver, for unknown reasons, turned to the right and subsequently struck a dirt embankment on the right shoulder. The Toyota then re-entered the roadway, crossed over the double yellow lines into the northbound lane, and crashed into a Tesla Cybertruck traveling north on SR-35 northbound. The Tesla driver sustained a suspected minor injury and declined medical transportation. No other injuries were reported.

"The idea that they can advertise their tech as ""self driving"" or use the word ""autopilot"" is the root of the problem to me. Both of those imply things the tech cannot actually achieve. To make matters worse, the tech requires constant vigilance and monitoring by the driver in case it fails, but has no mechanism to ensure the driver is actually performing that task. Going one step further, anyone with a passing familiarity with human factors will tell you one of the things humans are absolutely terrible at is monitoring an automated system - it's mind-numbingly boring and exceedingly easy to be distracted. Airline pilots that use autopilot systems, for example, have a whole host of other tasks they're expected to perform while operating on autopilot, and they go through extensive training to recognize and negate the inherent risks of using those systems - human factors is a huge topic in that industry. Tesla drivers have no such expertise or experience. So in reality, the design of Tesla's tech is deeply flawed from inception up. To accomplish what they promise, it either needs to be perfect under *all* possible conditions so the driver isn't required to monitor it at all times, or it needs to stop pretending to be an automated driving solution and function more like the driving assistance features found in competitors' vehicles.",35,0.8421863,0.14807385,0.009739837,negative,,,,,,

"Just for some additional context this article doesn't even cover some of the other crazy stuff he did in 2018 and why the threat of failure was even present during that period. Elon Musk was also sending out emails to everyone at Tesla stating that there was some collection of oil companies, wall street and the press that wanted to see them fail. He also repeatedly refused to raise additional equity capital throughout 2017 and 2018 stating that Tesla was going to self fund all its operations, largely because he was pissed off about negative coverage about the Model 3 ramp going poorly. This culminated early in 2019 with cash levels getting so low that Musk started talking about 'unwinding the wave' during the earnings call for the first time because the company was literally at risk of running out of cash as it shipped cars to Europe and had to wait to get paid during the longer transit times. What really took the pressure off was a combined debt and equity issuance after the Q1 earnings call that left the company flush with cash again and the subsequent clearing up of logistical problems shipping to Europe as well as the Model S/X raven refresh. Pretty much all the problems with the Model 3 ramp were also the result of Musk's 'Alient Dreadnought' plan to hyperautomate vehicle production despite the technology really not being there to do so. Pretty much every problem was, as usual, self inflicted. Shanghai did help the company immensely, largely because Tesla was able to copy and paste a working version of what they ended up doing for Model 3 production from the start and take advantage of lower labor and supply costs. Basically outsourcing 101 stuff versus the usual claims of fantastic innovation and amazing technology that Musk tends to point to. Even then profitability didn't really show up until the company started getting substantial regulatory credits from Europe, producing the Model Y with higher margins, and most importantly COVID putting them into a super advantageous position due to the auto shortage and Elon Musk pretty much falling into a pile of money by not cancelling supplier orders because he literally thought COVID was no worse than the common cold.

"I like Doug and am looking forward to watching this review later. I’ve also owned a Model 3P for about 65K miles now, and am a car enthusiast with a decent amount of ownership experience with several cars. In reality, the 3P is super heavy, super quick, not at all confidence-inspiring at speed (which is a hallmark of a good car), very poor steering feel but a super quick steering ratio, tons of ridiculous wind noise, horrible paint and fit and finish plus cheesy vinyl seats make it feel so cheap, a poorly designed but responsive UI, a very good stereo system, an outstanding lane keep system that really does make long trips easier, and EVs are very convenient for a typical homeowner. Pluses and minuses. New Teslas have no parking sensors, which is a joke. Getting a Tesla was an experiment for me and I knew what I was getting into. Even so, the horror show that is Tesla customer service still got to me. Ultimately, Doug is right, these are appliance cars, even the performance version. I still have some ICE cars for when I want to drive something fun. EDIT: I wrote the comment above before I watched the video. Good job, Doug! Your review totally aligns with my experience. I’ve always said the 3P is a great and very quick commuter car—if (1) you can put up with Tesla customer service, and (2) you can reliably charge every night at home or every day at the office. People who buy them without home or office charging are in for a terrible experience. Also, I am a little disappointed Doug didn’t point out the lack of parking sensors on the vehicle he tested.

">Electrek’s Take >I was personally disappointed in the conference call. First, we missed the first half of Musk’s opening statement because he was muted. >But that’s not the worst part. The worst part was that Tesla unmuted him, but they didn’t tell him. He didn’t restart his statement; he just continued as if nothing happened. And then it happened again halfway through the call. >It’s not the first time I’ve been worried about Musk being surrounded by yes men who are too afraid to give him bad news, and I wouldn’t be surprised if this is an example of that. >Secondly, I was disappointed by Musk skating around important questions. For example, he was asked a critical question about Tesla’s plan to eventually take legal responsibility for FSD; instead of responding, the CEO complained about people “already believing that Tesla has the responsibility” because they are suing the company, then claiming that Tesla achieved “baby AGI,” which is not an answer at all. >Lastly, he spent about half the call complaining about macroeconomics and interest rates, which I know are having a big impact on Tesla’s business right now, but it’s not a good look to complain a ton about something completely outside of the company’s power and then not answer questions that are within the company’s power. >It also feels like Musk is pushing this high interest issue too much. It has an undeniable impact, but it’s certainly not the only issue with demand because Tesla has reduced prices more over the last year than what it needed to keep monthly payments at the same price despite interest rate increases. >I shared my thoughts on this yesterday: >It does feel like Musk is spending too much time on X and stuck in his superfan-controlled feedback loop.",369,0.835291,0.1550704,0.00963856,negative,,,,,,

"From the article: The possible suspension of production at the plant of the American automaker Tesla due to a clear excess of permissible environmental pollution standards is reported by TASS, citing the German television channel N-tv. This information comes from a letter from the Strausberg-Erkner Water Supply Association (WSE). According to WSE, the Tesla plant in Grünheide, Brandenburg, violated established standards for water pollutants. Discharges of phosphorus and nitrogen into wastewater continued in large volumes for about two years, exceeding the permissible norm by six times. WSE is calling on city mayors in the region to close Tesla’s waste pipes, which could lead to the suspension of production at the plant. According to the warning from the Institute of Freshwater Ecology and Inland Fisheries named after. Leibniz (IGB) in Berlin, high concentrations of harmful substances in wastewater could threaten the drinking water supply of the German capital.",155,0.3668174,0.61984986,0.013332775,neutral,,,,,,

"*From Bloomberg News reporter Esha Dey:* Tesla shares are set to wipe out nearly one-fifth of their value in less than two weeks amid growing concerns that demand for electric cars is starting to weaken. The selloff started earlier this month when the electric-vehicle giant dialed back growth expectations during its third quarter earnings call. That was followed by grim commentary from several global automakers, as well as Wall Street analysts. This week, battery-maker Panasonic Holdings Corp. and chipmaker ON Semiconductor Corp. also sounded alarms for the EV industry. The warnings have weighed on stocks across the US automotive sector, which has also been battling extensive negotiations with its labor unions over wages. Still, Tesla’s decline stands out: shares have sunk around 20% since the Oct. 18 report, compared to a 3.6% drop in the S&P 500 Index, and a more than 4% decline in the Nasdaq 100. The retreat in the EV-maker’s stock price has erased about $145 billion from the company’s market capitalization.",30,0.65880746,0.327026,0.014166556,negative,,,,,,

"Exaggerated range was the first thing we realized was a gimmick on our Model X, and so began our distrust of Tesla. Our Model X had an EPA range of over 300 miles. On the highway it could barely do 200 miles. Yet our Audi E-tron (the other EV we had at that time) had an EPA range of around 210 miles and could do the same distance as the Model X on the highway. Our Model X also was slow to charge. It was fairly fast from 10% - 45%, but then it tapered quickly. It would regularly take 40 minutes to reach 70-80%. Our Audi was able to charge from 10% to 80% in just over 20 minutes. We quickly realized we were sold a lie. We ended up getting rid of our Model X after 3 years.",320,0.77473605,0.2067943,0.018469691,negative,,,,,,

"I drive a 2023 Taycan Turbo S now, EPA puts it at 222 and we got that range in Jan/Feb 2023 when it was in the teens and 20’s here in the Northeast. Now that it’s summer, wife charged to 95% the other day and the range estimator read 278. And it actually DOES achieve it. We also went away for almost 3 weeks and the percentage and remaining mileage didn’t change, where our old Model S would’ve lost anywhere from 50-100 miles of range (30% battery), depending on temperature, during that time (without Sentry mode). They might think it’s clever marketing, but the misestimation of range also affects the Nav/charging planner as it believes the “rosy” estimate. With our Model S, we were driving in January upstate New York to pick up a puppy and the estimator told us to supercharge to X%, then drive to the next supercharger where we would arrive with 50 miles remaining and then top up again and continue. Wife smartly said “I don’t trust it, let’s charge an extra 50 miles range so we arrive with 100, who knows?” — we charged the extra 50 miles and got to the next supercharger with… 48 miles remaining.

"Can confirm some software oddities regarding battery SOC. Model 3 RWD with the LFP pack. When I charge to 100%, I can drive about 5 miles, and the car would state that I'm still at 100%. After those 5 miles, the SOC would degrade as expected. Supposed to have 275 miles of range, never use that much, and the battery always predicts less. The best I've ever gotten has been 260 miles of predicted range, with a weeks worth of driving at a max of 60mph and no AC use (it was cool enough I didn't need to use AC or heat), ideal temperature for the battery. I use the AC in the summer now, and depending on how hot the day is, I can use anywhere from 2% to 5% more battery on my 20 mile commute, than what it ""expected"".
