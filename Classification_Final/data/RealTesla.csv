"""Stainless"" isn't real for steels. As I learned from a hobby in knife collecting, stainlessness isn't a binary category. There are some exceptionally stainless tool steels like LC200N, in which nitrogen is a more important alloying ingredient than carbon, that can survive extremely corrosive environments. These steels are expensive, and not suitable for sheet metal/cladding usage. Basic stainless steel chemistry like the X50CrMoV15 in most/many German kitchen knives will corrode, too. With respect to whatever alloy Tesla is using for the Cybertruck, its also not 100% stainless. Road salt, or sea shore humid conditions can still corrode. Want to protect it, then coat it with a thin layer of wax and polish, and spray less accessible parts like door interiors with waxy coatings. I expect most of the early reports of rust on the Cybertruck are not from the cladding, but from structural steel, rivets, or welds.

"> Musk, however, has insisted that Tesla's cars only use optical sensors, likening it to how humans primarily use their eyes to drive This right here shows just how UNintelegent, and two-dimensional, fElon's thinking is. It reads like something said by someone who doesn't fully understand how driving works. Don't forget Humans do not rely on vision alone to drive. We use stereoscopic vision, hearing, proprioception (sense of where our body and limbs are in space, extending to the body of the car itself), our vestibular sense (Sense of balance/orientation), and our somatosensory system (sense of touch) all in concert to control a vehicle. On the computational side we also have object permanence and nearly instantaneous extrapolation from limited datasets (Think being able to tell what a sign is even if it's mostly obscured, or knowing where a car went when you saw it for a half second before it went behind a truck), not to mention our ability to, on an unconscious level, anticipate the actions of other drivers and pedestrians on the road. Driving is not a simple task, and no limited-scope AI system that is possible with the technology we have today, and that will fit neatly into a car, will be able to handle it as well as a human. The only people who think otherwise watched too much Knight Rider in the 80's. (Which I can definitely imaging fElon doing) That's not to say we won't get there eventually, Wamo, Cruze, Aurora, and the other companies working on SDCs are getting there, but we aren't there yet.",26,0.4507098,0.5215654,0.027724847,neutral

Musk is intrinsic to the value of his companies, potentially putting at risk around $1 trillion in assets held by investors, tens of thousands of jobs and big parts of the U.S. space program**…Then in 2018, people familiar with Musk’s behavior said, another incident seemed to mark a turning point for him—and showed that his drug use could have consequences for his businesses. That year, Musk got into trouble with NASA for smoking marijuana on the Joe Rogan show, raising red flags for some about the business impact of Musk’s conduct and causing employees at SpaceX to be randomly tested for drugs…In addition to violating federal contracts, any kind of illegal drug use would break company policies at both SpaceX and Tesla, and would raise questions about Musk’s executive role at the publicly traded Tesla, where the board has a duty to shareholders to oversee management…Some Tesla board members over the years have talked among themselves about their concerns over Musk’s alleged drug use but haven’t said anything formally that would end up as an official board agenda item or in meeting minutes, people familiar with the discussions said…In the Isaacson book, Musk is quoted as saying, “I really don’t like doing illegal drugs”…**Illegal drug use by employees is also in violation of the rules that govern the more than $14 billion in contracts that Musk’s private rocket company, SpaceX, has with the U.S. government for civilian and military space missions. Federal contracts require that companies comply with the Drug-Free Workplace Act and foster a drug-free culture with programs and policies, regardless of any state laws that may legalize some usage. Contractors can also lose security clearances because of drug abuse, defined as the use of illegal drugs or prescription medications “in a manner that deviates from approved medical direction.” In his role as CEO and founder of SpaceX, Musk has a security clearance that gives him access to classified information.**…Behind the scenes, things were much more dire: Musk had been under the influence as he answered the reporters’ questions, according to people briefed on the episode. The CEO hadn’t informed Tesla’s communications team that he was giving the interview, people familiar with the episode said…**Soon after, Musk smoked marijuana on the comedian Rogan’s show, which can be streamed online. NASA demanded written assurances that SpaceX was complying with the federal drug-free workplace law and spent $5 million in taxpayer dollars on training for SpaceX employees, according to a letter NASA sent to the company and federal contracting records**…Corporate contractors must follow standard NASA guidelines for drug tests that usually check for marijuana and cocaine and have the ability to also test for amphetamines, opiates and PCP.

What people don’t realize is right now a Jeep has incentives that’s at least 15% off MSRP if not more. The difference is price transparency. Regular dealers do not discount the MSRP. Some people pay the inflated MSRP other’s research and score massive discount. Tesla provides you the price upfront. This is great. Lower prices and transparent pricing are great for consumers. The people that are upset; you were happy with the price before; you bought it. Enjoy it. It’s like buying a house in todays market; there is no guarantee your house will appreciate. And when the next recession hit and it lowers the house prices what are going to do; sell your house at a loss because prices went down or just enjoy living in it.,2,0.09136699,0.43342263,0.4752104,positive

This isn’t Musk being evil or dumb it’s a good thing company’s should do. I’ve seen some talk in the comments about Tesla’s being investments and or resale value potential, but you shouldn’t buy a car because of that. Cars depreciate, obviously. In terms of resale, you made a decision based on a fluctuating and new market (Tesla cars) and shouldn’t be surprised if it doesn’t go in your favor. Also don’t buy a car because of resale unless you have money to waste on new cars all the time. Also Musk is a clown who has no real influence on prices or car development besides adding a fart button. He didn’t do any of this not that it matters.",1,0.71539456,0.25290316,0.031702243,negative

Different individuals needed to make up the compensation committee - it needed to be fair and impartial and geared towards protecting the company, but it wasn’t.",21,0.45105737,0.52552146,0.023421139,neutral

">The files contain over 1,000 accident reports involving phantom braking or unintended acceleration--mostly in the U.S. and Germany. >A German news outlet sifted through over 23,000 of Tesla’s internal files and found a disturbing trend of brushing off customers complaining about dangerous Autopilot glitches while covering the company’s ass. >The Tesla files contain more than 2,400 self-acceleration complaints and more than 1,500 braking function problems, including 139 cases of unintentional emergency braking and 383 reported phantom stops resulting from false collision warnings. The number of crashes is more than 1000. A table of incidents involving driver assistance systems where customers have expressed safety concerns has more than 3000 entries. >The oldest complaints available to the Handelsblatt date from 2015, the most recent from March 2022. During this period, Tesla delivered around 2.6 million vehicles with the autopilot software. Most of the incidents took place in the US , but there are also complaints from Europe and Asia in the documents - including many from German Tesla drivers. >The Handelsblatt contacted dozens of customers from several countries. All confirmed the information from the Tesla files. In discussions, they gave insights into their experiences with the autopilot. Some disclosed their communication with the US automaker, others showed Handelsblatt reporters videos of the accident.﻿ >How did the company deal with complaints? The Tesla files also provide information about this. The files show that employees have precise guidelines for communicating with customers. The top priority is obviously: offer as little attack surface as possible. >__For each incident there are bullet points for the “technical review”. The employees who enter this review into the system regularly make it clear that the report is “for internal use only”. Each entry also contains a note in bold type that information, if at all, may only be passed on “VERBALLY to the customer”.__ >__“Do not copy and paste the report below into an email, text message, or leave it in a voicemail to the customer,” it said. Vehicle data should also not be released without permission. If, despite the advice, “an involvement of a lawyer cannot be prevented”, this must be recorded.__ >__Customers that Handelsblatt spoke to have the impression that Tesla employees avoid written communication. “They never sent emails, everything was always verbal,” says the doctor from California, whose Tesla said it accelerated on its own in the fall of 2021 and crashed into two concrete pillars.﻿__ - Looks like they aren't reporting most of these incidents to NHTSA, something that __should__ (probably won't) be a huge crime. Tesla built a system where everything is internal to them, they have complete control over everything and a backdoor to everything.

I formally worked for a company that purchased a large quantity of Teslas and our internal documentation noted unintentional acceleration, unintentional braking, and battery issues from a certain client that I have heard corresponds with rough road conditions. The Tesla rep that was my contact always assured me that the vision system was just as accurate as the radar going so far as to say the radar system was still being monitored by the vehicle at all times and the car cannot accelerate without pedal input and there where multiple failsafes that would always ensure the peddle was depressed. When pressed about the battery issues we reported my contact would only say it was under investigation but I was never given a reasonable follow up and unable to assure to our client the vehicles where indeed safe. The Tesla reps I have had contact with before my departure from my former employer always assured us they would know if the cars where doing the things we reported but claimed they had no records of the problems we had. Internal documentation and investigation showed an above average amount of complaints and concerns generated by the Tesla vehicles over other manufacturers. Tesla was adamant that this was just coincidence and definitely not a consistent issue with their vehicles going so far to imply we should document every manufacturer implying that we do not take customer safety and concerns seriously. At the time of my departure the company I worked for still had many Tesla vehicles in fleet and many happy clients but even with the admittedly vast difference in sales between Tesla and your average vehicle manufacturer it was alarming the amount of concerns and complaints generated by Tesla vehicles. They obviously overall where less than another manufacturer such as Toyota but considering how many less where in fleet their incident percentage was above average and for serious safety issues.

Wow so I’m not the only one. I was driving a model 3 on the 10 freeway (Los Angeles) cruising 65 with cruise control (autopilot) on. I’ve had speed and lane assist on and I’ve suddenly experienced a heavy braking for no reason. It was about 2 AM so there were no cars in front or beside me. The car slowed down to about 30 mph and continuing to slow. I had to accelerate myself otherwise I believe I would’ve stopped completely. May I remind you that I’m on the freeway. I got off the freeway immediately and I started researching about what may be the cause. It’s when I realized other people are experiencing this same problem and they’re calling it phantom braking. I too complained to Tesla but they didn’t do anything at all. The car was a lease so I returned it as soon as I could. Tesla is a good car but the autopilot system is bad. I would still drive a Tesla but only if they say they fix this issue 100%. It’s needless to say the issue is beyond terrifying. Imagine an 80 year old lady who’s reaction isn’t as quick as I am and didn’t realize the problem and accelerated off. The outcome could’ve been catastrophic and even deadly.,3,0.23511666,0.5807227,0.18416066,neutral

It usually yells at you anyways when it sees traffic cones and such, but just don't take the chance. It might get confused with intersecting lines, lack of shoulders, etc. - if you pass a section of road where the left lane expands for a turn lane, or where the lines temporarily disappear, your car might yank you into that zone unexpectedly. I would say it's happened to me 10 times ever, but one time almost rammed me into the side of a bridge out of nowhere. Scared the crap out of me, but solidified my distrust in the system.

"ChatGPT has shown its training process. The key to AI training is feedback. OpenAI hired hundreds of humans to critique its earlier models, which then created a separate AI model that scores the main model called the Critic Model. Vision only has no critic except an awkward user feedback process that doesn’t give precisely what went wrong. You can have more data than atoms in the universe, but without a feedback method to tell AI what is a good data point, and what’s a failed data point. AI will never learn anything. If vision has radar and lidar backing it up, not only there will be redundancy, there would be a critic feedback method to improve vision AI. If early vision AI misses a car, thinking it’s painting on a white semi behind it, but a radar/lidar reading says a car is there. Then the data can be used to improve vision AI so it has less chance of a mistake next time. Just vision only data does nothing for the AI training.

This used to be more common, but it's becoming less of an issue. 2) When a car turns left in front of me, more than half a mile in front of me, the car will slam on the brakes. Again, this seems to be less of a problem, but it's scary as hell. This also would not be fixed by lidar. I do believe that a car that can 'see' the road and analyze what it sees, signs, potholes, obstacles, and then make a plan based on that vision would be way more reliable.

"My problem with Tesla (as an owner) is less about Musk’s politics and general douchery, but Tesla’s lack of delivery on its products and the grifty way the company is run.

On the other hand, they can’t get automatic wipers or auto parking to work, not because cheap technological fixes don’t exist (they do) but because they have this absurd strategy of using vision for everything. FSD not ever being delivered and this limited beta concept on a production car of key features is also annoying anyone who actually believed the lies and paid for it.

I mean I buy that Musk’s bullshit is hurting the brand - duh - that’s been obvious for more than a year. But he still doesn’t see Tesla as a car company because “it’s a tech company” because “the moat is pretty deep”. The moat In My Opinion is that its charger network is second to none. Conventional car manufacturers don’t have that (they don’t need to) so it does help right now. But that was a necessary condition in order to sell EVs and whilst it may have great long term potential it’s still just table-stakes for EVs and a temporary advantage over EV competition. Tesla also makes batteries cheaper and on a larger scale than anyone else. But all that scale gives it a margin advantage on cars - the potential of utility grade energy storage is not going to change the company’s margins positively and isn’t much in its current revenue mix. And is FSD - if it ever works safely - going to make Tesla not a car company? It’s a car company. Trading at a crazy EBIT multiple.

"As a exterior automotive/truck designer, I will say that we beg, borrow, and steal for every **millimeter** to mitigate side-vision obscuration. A-pilar development is critical and paramount in the early phases of design, as it determines roof line/height, windshield shape, seating position, belt-line height, and most importantly, vision. Why does the flag panel go from belt-line to roof-line, just so mirrors can be removed? As the most critical safety structural frame feature, it is completed early, then rarely changed. This current design (if actual) is a no-go. In addition to this monolithic child-killing pillar, the squared corner fender/hood is so high, it also blocks vision. This truck looks like it was designed by a child, or at best, amatuers, but I'm thinking both (see what I did there?).",2,0.5054581,0.4289243,0.065617606,negative

"In 1989 I was in the the market for a new car. I wanted an upscale sedan from what I had previously been able to afford, and I was considering this new car Toyota was bringing to market in its new brand, Lexus. I had owned Toyotas before and respected the company, but, Lexus was totally new. As the car neared market lots of reviews and speculation came forth. The car looked like it had what I was after, but… Finally, I read a review from some Mercedes engineers who got their hands on one of the first Lexus cars on the ground and tore it down because it was designed to be their competition. After dismantling the car completely bolt by bolt, they issued their opinion, which was that Toyota was “trying to buy the market and there was no way in hell they could produce such a car for $39,500.” Their equivalent Mercedes was somewhere in excess of $60,000 at the time, as I recall. I took their conclusion to heart and allowed Toyota to buy me in, so I purchased two in the fall of 1989. Turned out they were both terrific buys, and were practically bullet-proof first rattle out of the box for a new car company. How the hell did they do that! I got a couple of friends to follow suit, and theirs were great too. All needed the tires swapped out early on because Lexus missed on that, but did it under warranty, and all had the air conditioner fail just @ the 50k mile warranty period also, which Lexus covered too. But, thank you Merc engineers for your guidance. Thinking back, one deciding factor besides the big one of price difference was that the Lexus had drink holders and Mercs with their Germanic austerity refused to incorporate at that time. I bought a string of Lexus LS models with a few BMW’s, Jag’s, Lincoln’s, etc. thrown in until going Tesla. Never did buy a Mercedes though.

"Unfortunately he is a typical example of more money than sense! I do genuinely fear he is having some form of mental breakdown though, and that’s not meant to be offensive to anyone who does genuinely struggle with mental health, I totally understand the struggles people may have at times with mental health however being the CEO of multiple large companies does require your physical and mental health to be at its best otherwise your judgment may get clouded and you may make very bad decisions. He has made lots of very impulsive and badly thought out commercial decisions, which sadly for investors could and have had a negative impact upon all of his businesses and in investor equity. His bid for Twitter without fully understanding its financials and then trying to pull out of the deal was a prime example. In any business takeover deal you always perform due diligence long before you make a formal offer, not make an offer then view the financials and in seeing them then try to change it or rescind your offer. In rare cases where you need to make an urgent bid for a company without fully understand it’s finances then you always do so conditionally upon the final and binding offer only upon completion of due diligence. I genuinely hope he isn’t having some form of either mid life crisis or mental health crisis, the difficulty is when he is in the position that he is in that there are few people prepared to challenge bad decisions that he might make, and of course when you are reasonably wealthy you can simply fire advisors or lawyers until you get the answer you want rather than the best advice, even if that advice isn’t what you wanted to hear!",6,0.8351662,0.15436767,0.010466059,negative

I would say this construction and design would be super cool if it was a car built by an eccentric science fiction fan in your hometown who decided to strip down a truck and make their own fan-fic version of a truck from a movie or a truck they designed to look like it belongs in an old science fiction movie. It does not look cool or impressive being built by a huge car manufacturer with professional engineers and designers and manufacturing specialists putting it together. It looks like someone let a child become CEO and he tampered with the design process of professional and competent employees to force them to create this shit that will in my opinion be hard as hell to market. Imagine your friend coming by to pick you up in this car they just paid a bunch of money for… I would think they lost their mind. Tesla will also need the Cybertruck to compete with the Ford F-150 Lightning which is an electric version of the most popular pickup truck currently on the market… it also starts at $50k USD and even though Elon has claimed the Cybertruck would start at $40k USD I think we all know that won’t be true when it comes out. Will be interesting to see if Tesla is able to keep up the hype they have built for other cars they released for this new truck it looks like they spent no time designing or engineering. It’s also going to be interesting because apparently the Cybertruck is supposed to be commercially available before the end of 2023?

I've been in meetings all week over 0.5mm, companies that give a shit monitor this stuff heavily. Typically gap and flush has a bilateral tolerance of +/-1.0mm if not less. That's a full build, not part tolerance or assembly tolerance. I've said this a million times: I truly believe Tesla rarely measures anything, let alone reacts to it. We full measure each vehicle per week (5000 pts) and there are numerous other checks for gap and flush, fitment, door close effort, wind noise, water leak, striker rub, etc. Gap and flush is checked by laser daily, and you get email alerts if something is off. In a respectable plant, this stuff would NEVER ship. Hell, you don't see fits this bad on trial units, with 3d printed parts, concept tools, and hand built because you don't have tooling yet. This is atrocious. Anyways, back to the point. We measure door hinge nut position, surface mating conditions, pitches, etc. Nearly everything you want to see is live or a day or two old. (Doors are done separately from the vehicle, then in a vehicle for true condition, also to measure 4M changes etc.) If you see something you don't like, you scan it all, accurate to microns. We have multiple labs that handle this stuff, along with cameras and lasers in the line that tell you when something is jacked up. I'm fully convinced Tesla has an either blind quality department, or a non-existent one. I'm an engineer for an OEM, we have 200+ engineers in quality alone, just in my plant. We have hundreds in process, paint, safety, manufacturing, tooling, plastics, etc. Seems the 'king of manufacturing' has no fucking clue what he's doing aside from grifting his customers.

Why do people keep saying there are no crumple zones? That would be illegal. The crumple zones are built into the frame. A head on collision results in dispersing the kinetic transfer across the entire length of the truck.

"10 years ago or so, I spent a couple of summers working as a mechanic and PDI-er at a shop that mostly sold Chinese scooters. Often those really really cheap Chinese scooters that you could buy on Alibaba for like $250 each if you bought a pallet. My boss would buy a pallet and we'd assemble them and sell they for $600 or so. Their plastics made all the same kind of sounds. That had features that *looked* alright. If you like stood back 10 feet and just looked. Like drink holders. Or little storage comparments below the handlebars. Or even the mirrors. They looked fine. But as soon as you touched them you could feel that they were just utter crap. Anything that opened or moved made that creaking noise. Nothing that was supposed to stay in one place - like the mirrors - would be loose on delivery or you could just tell that after 50 miles they'd be loose. Panel gaps here atrocious. Things that were supposed to pop on would invariably have some of the clips broken off on delivery. Screw holes would crack out around them so the screw would just fall through. And it was impossible to get any parts. People would buy these scooters and come back like two weeks later ""hey this panel around the headlight broke, I need to get a new one"". Like how do you tell someone that this thing that they bought for $600 or $100 or $1500 (for the 250cc version), you can't repair or make it look new again.

"Have a model 3 and was lucky to buy whilst there were federal rebates on it still. Would i buy another? No, and this is why. -Nearly all panels on my car were misaligned, and some were hilariously off. Had to take my bramdnew car back so they fix that, which took them weeks. When I asked the service person, she replied: ""we're busy because of tesla's popularity"", and i replied: ""if it were built correctly, you would not be so busy, regardless of the popularity"" -road noise is awful. You can hear everything and the car often creaks when driving up a driveway, which is unsettling. -all the plastic is very cheap; had to change the cabin filter and the car's panels are held together by tiny plastic screws, hence some of the noise -hot in the sun: i get that the cool panoramic view is nice to have, but in SoCal, the car spends most of its energy trying to keep cool, which affects range -paint is flimsy: prepapre to chip your hood with random stuff on the road. I had a 10 year old car with 150K miles and less chipping than my model 3 -FSD is a fantasy: go ahead and drop $10K for something that's not even remotely close to working.

Going one step further, anyone with a passing familiarity with human factors will tell you one of the things humans are absolutely terrible at is monitoring an automated system - it's mind-numbingly boring and exceedingly easy to be distracted. Airline pilots that use autopilot systems, for example, have a whole host of other tasks they're expected to perform while operating on autopilot, and they go through extensive training to recognize and negate the inherent risks of using those systems - human factors is a huge topic in that industry. Tesla drivers have no such expertise or experience. So in reality, the design of Tesla's tech is deeply flawed from inception up.

He enjoys some luxuries but not like the typical billionaire. He doesn’t have mansions and yachts for days for example. He works 16 hour days 7 days a week basically. That’s what he likes to do. He’s a different breed. That doesn’t mean you should worship him, it’s not exemplary. Infact it’s sad, very sad. People who work with him consistently say he’s the smartest person in the room. He makes rapid decisions and forces changes up and down his companies. He knows far more about the technicals of his companies’ products than a typical ceo. He sets audacious goals and visions for companies that stick and create narratives for employees that really is palpable. When you look at Twitter, there’s a ton to criticize, but also a lot to be amazed by - not necessarily a “good” amazement but amazement non the less. He cut rapidly cut 80% of the workforce , and so many of the people on this thread declared it will crumble over night. Instead it’s still running and by some metrics it’s running better (some metrics it is running worse). He turned an established company to operate like a startup within one month. Again, questionable if that was a good decision, but amazing that he was able to do that none the less. At the end of this rant my point is: give the devil his due. You don’t have to like him or agree with him, or think he’s a net positive force to respect and acknowledge his accomplishments. When I see people say “he just bought his way through family wealth and luck to get where he is” I automatically know that you aren’t able to think critically. Same is true for those who treat him like a tech saviour.",0,0.20953053,0.6666876,0.123781815,neutral
"He never said it funded his entire carreer, he said the money helped Elon go to the US and pay for his education. That's like saying you have absolutely no merits in your professional life because your parents helped you pay for college. Even if this was true, his dad didn't help him with Paypal, Tesla, SpaceX, Boring Company or Solar City. What is all this BS about emerald money making Elon's fortune even for? It's like y'all want people to believe that privileged people don't need to do any efforts to be at the top, and that's just nonsense. If most people made the same amount of efforts, they wouldn't be where he's at. I get that. But thinking that anyone would be in his place without working for it is just pure delusion.",-5,0.55732536,0.40484217,0.037832543,negative
"I mean I'm sure I'll get downvoted into oblivion with this one, but I have a terrible knack of looking at the devil's advocate side of all things. When it comes to Elon, I tend to compare him pretty directly to my older brother, who also has Aspergers, so while I don't wanna make excuses for 90% of Elon's behavior, I do have to say that his dickish, unempathetic, and downright weird behavior is absolutely, in part, due to his Aspergers. My older brother (40M) is incredibly intelligent, but socially a mess, does not grasp cues, can be weirdly childish and immature, and comes across to most humans as incredibly selfish to the point of being a complete ass. That being said, I know he's got a good heart, and not aware of the implications or interpreted meaning behind many of his actions. He doesn't want to admit he has Aspergers, but he 100% does. While you cannot lay everything at the syndrome, you can definitely lay a lot of it there. Elon is, to many degrees, my brother but with inherited money. You have to look at these people with a slightly different lens than if you were dealing with a normal human. Again, don't want my comment to be misconstrued as excusing Elon or his behavior, because no matter what, it's pretty atrocious, but I also don't want folks who haven't interacted with people who have Aspergers, to be completely in the dark about maybe *why* someone could be like Elon. Downvote away.",-6,0.8109551,0.17284283,0.016202118,negative
"I mean, though I used to think he is, Elon clearly isn’t perfect. I’d say that you shouldn’t lie about where you came from. If you used your parents money to get to where you are, that’s fine, just don’t lie about it. Be honest and truthful. On top of that, he has many other flaws, in my opinion. However, regardless of his moral fiber, I don’t think it can be denied that he is and has been doing a lot of things to help the world. The new green electric car explosion is in large part due to Tesla, which he was a large part of. He might play a gigantic part in solving automotive autonomy (self driving cars), if the Tesla FSD software reaches level 5 autonomy soon. That would likely save countless lives and a lot of time in the long run. Starlink is connecting new people to the internet all the time, some I believe who are in 3rd world countries. SpaceX is driving our space capabilities forward, helping us become an interplanetary species, along with essentially spawning Starlink. Tesla Optimus might eventually make a whole lot of us able to use more of our creativity and intelligence, instead of working in manual labor. He also called for a UBI in response if I remember correctly. While he clearly wasn’t the sole individual responsible for the endeavors above, he was pretty much definitely a large part of all of them. I think he even had something to do with openAI, which recently released ChatGPT and changed the world. And idk, maybe some of his shortcomings are necessary. People like an independent origin story. Most don’t look too fondly at someone using his parents money to make his life. And many of his endeavors, such as Tesla, relied quite heavily on his charisma and people liking him, at least at first. I’m not quite sure about this, but I can see investors being more likely to invest in the endeavors of someone they believe is completely self-made; someone who hasn’t used his parents money at all. Either way, I’m glad he is here because, without him, human innovation and renewable efforts would likely not be where it is today. Edit: Didn’t expect the downvotes. Wow, people really hate Elon. Can’t say I completely blame you guys. He says and does a lot of messed up stuff. I just… really think and hope his effect is extremely net positive because of the ripples his companies have had and are having. Idk, I might be wrong.",-8,0.278267,0.5697402,0.15199286,neutral

"Just for some additional context this article doesn't even cover some of the other crazy stuff he did in 2018 and why the threat of failure was even present during that period. Elon Musk was also sending out emails to everyone at Tesla stating that there was some collection of oil companies, wall street and the press that wanted to see them fail. He also repeatedly refused to raise additional equity capital throughout 2017 and 2018 stating that Tesla was going to self fund all its operations, largely because he was pissed off about negative coverage about the Model 3 ramp going poorly. This culminated early in 2019 with cash levels getting so low that Musk started talking about 'unwinding the wave' during the earnings call for the first time because the company was literally at risk of running out of cash as it shipped cars to Europe and had to wait to get paid during the longer transit times. What really took the pressure off was a combined debt and equity issuance after the Q1 earnings call that left the company flush with cash again and the subsequent clearing up of logistical problems shipping to Europe as well as the Model S/X raven refresh. Pretty much all the problems with the Model 3 ramp were also the result of Musk's 'Alient Dreadnought' plan to hyperautomate vehicle production despite the technology really not being there to do so. Pretty much every problem was, as usual, self inflicted. Shanghai did help the company immensely, largely because Tesla was able to copy and paste a working version of what they ended up doing for Model 3 production from the start and take advantage of lower labor and supply costs. Basically outsourcing 101 stuff versus the usual claims of fantastic innovation and amazing technology that Musk tends to point to. Even then profitability didn't really show up until the company started getting substantial regulatory credits from Europe, producing the Model Y with higher margins, and most importantly COVID putting them into a super advantageous position due to the auto shortage and Elon Musk pretty much falling into a pile of money by not cancelling supplier orders because he literally thought COVID was no worse than the common cold. I think SpaceX is in a similar position with a combination of NASA contracts and the DoD using Starlink for battlefield communication in Ukraine finally giving the company enough revenue to end up in the black.",39,0.7001224,0.2847294,0.015148165,negative

I’ve also owned a Model 3P for about 65K miles now, and am a car enthusiast with a decent amount of ownership experience with several cars. In reality, the 3P is super heavy, super quick, not at all confidence-inspiring at speed (which is a hallmark of a good car), very poor steering feel but a super quick steering ratio, tons of ridiculous wind noise, horrible paint and fit and finish plus cheesy vinyl seats make it feel so cheap, a poorly designed but responsive UI, a very good stereo system, an outstanding lane keep system that really does make long trips easier, and EVs are very convenient for a typical homeowner. Pluses and minuses. New Teslas have no parking sensors, which is a joke. Getting a Tesla was an experiment for me and I knew what I was getting into. Even so, the horror show that is Tesla customer service still got to me. Ultimately, Doug is right, these are appliance cars, even the performance version. I still have some ICE cars for when I want to drive something fun. EDIT: I wrote the comment above before I watched the video. Good job, Doug! Your review totally aligns with my experience. I’ve always said the 3P is a great and very quick commuter car—if (1) you can put up with Tesla customer service, and (2) you can reliably charge every night at home or every day at the office. People who buy them without home or office charging are in for a terrible experience. Also, I am a little disappointed Doug didn’t point out the lack of parking sensors on the vehicle he tested.

" It’s honestly worth closer to $0. The only reason Tesla gives you an extra $3000 for it upon trade-in is because they are already lowballing you so much on the price of the entire vehicle. Now that 2022 is gone.. and prices of used Teslas have fallen dramatically the long-term value of FSD is and scrutinize more than ever. Which is the only reason why Tesla is giving $3,000 back for it. Also, now, that 2023.20.X software includes the FSD beta on practically all newer Teslas. Anybody can now pay the $199 monthly subscription fee to try the beta for themselves and see just how well it works. Good luck convincing somebody to pay $15,000 after that experience. The cat is out the bag. In My Opinion Tesla needs to revamp their entire software suite. At least as far as pricing goes: 1)Automatic lane changes should be included free with auto pilot. 2)EAP should be priced at $1000 and include all of the advance features like smart summon & navigate on auto pilot. 3) FSD should be priced at $3,000 as a standalone license on a single car. Especially since that is what Tesla values it at. Anybody who has already paid upwards of $15,000 for FSD.. should be converted to a lifetime license that works with any Tesla their driver profile is currently logged into.",4,0.27964553,0.54534656,0.17500791,neutral

"Nah if you are as smart as Musk is (not saying I’m a fan), and you also have his goals too, you will internally realize the futility of trying to improve the life of/ save a species of inherently selfish, greedy, conniving, assholes who make up a very small part of the population, but have enough influence to turn their greed into self genocide for the whole species of humans. Musk’s depression isn’t “genetic” It’s the result of the convergence of good morals, high intellect, and a realistic world view… many people suffer from this affliction, but aren’t famous enough to need to put a self help depression improvement PR spin on his solution of using ketamine to cope with staring “death”, the destroyer of worlds, in the face, and not lose all hope. The fact he’s as smart as he is and hasn’t already lost hope proves how optimistic this mofo is and if he can do it cuz of ketamine, good bless him and keep going with it. Unfortunately here the human species as a collective unit, despite what % of us are innocent beings or nefarious perpetrators… is “death” the destroyer of worlds. If you think I’m wrong I encourage you to simply list the number of privately and publicly held for profit vs non-profit entities in the US alone. Inherently if you are for-profit and operate long enough, you will reach a point (or run into other individuals which will) where profits matter more then human lives. Ergo modern day American bridging that transition. If that isn’t enough for you start looking at the analytics of other countries’ people in power, to people being subjugated percentages. I welcome any and all retorts as if you can retort that you may not just save my mental state, but musk’s as well.

">Electrek’s Take >I was personally disappointed in the conference call. First, we missed the first half of Musk’s opening statement because he was muted. >But that’s not the worst part. The worst part was that Tesla unmuted him, but they didn’t tell him. He didn’t restart his statement; he just continued as if nothing happened. And then it happened again halfway through the call. >It’s not the first time I’ve been worried about Musk being surrounded by yes men who are too afraid to give him bad news, and I wouldn’t be surprised if this is an example of that. >Secondly, I was disappointed by Musk skating around important questions. For example, he was asked a critical question about Tesla’s plan to eventually take legal responsibility for FSD; instead of responding, the CEO complained about people “already believing that Tesla has the responsibility” because they are suing the company, then claiming that Tesla achieved “baby AGI,” which is not an answer at all. >Lastly, he spent about half the call complaining about macroeconomics and interest rates, which I know are having a big impact on Tesla’s business right now, but it’s not a good look to complain a ton about something completely outside of the company’s power and then not answer questions that are within the company’s power. >It also feels like Musk is pushing this high interest issue too much. It has an undeniable impact, but it’s certainly not the only issue with demand because Tesla has reduced prices more over the last year than what it needed to keep monthly payments at the same price despite interest rate increases. >I shared my thoughts on this yesterday: >It does feel like Musk is spending too much time on X and stuck in his superfan-controlled feedback loop.",369,0.835291,0.1550704,0.00963856,negative

"This seems like the ElonHaters subreddit. I don't care if you hate Elon. He is usually talking crap so have your own opinion on him. But my Tesla has been the best purchase of my life. The Aussie Tesla's are built in China so maybe they are just better quality. I'm not a Tesla fanboy, I just test drove the car and decided it was for me. As for the $25k car, it was knocked back a lot because Elon didn't like the design. Most of the internals would not change and would have been worked on for many years. The car was supposed to be made in Mexico but that factory is being delayed by government red tape. The car is currently being worked on at one of the American factories (can't remember which one). The Robotaxi is the same platform as the $25k car. But it will be different. As it will be mostly part of a taxi service, it needs more durable materials and be less prone to getting taken out of commission by the users (I'm sure lots of haters will try to damage it). I get that autonomous driving cars is a scary idea and most people don't want to share the road with them, but frankly I am sick of sharing the road with drunk drivers, people that speed, people that never check their blind spots and road rage. Tell me how a robot will do a worse job than these idiots on the road? Humans drive with vision and sound. Maybe some feedback through the steering wheel. How is the camera based approach different from that? The car has up to 12 cameras, humans have 2 eyes and multiple mirrors. Obviously, we will have to wait till the product is actually complete to see how it does in the real world. If you research cars that use LIDAR, you will see that the cost of the LIDAR systems are expensive, it is obviously not a great way to scale autonomous driving at an affordable price. Will autonomous driving work without LIDAR? Again, we will have to see if the end product of FSD is successful or not. I'm not trying to defend Elon.

Because of that, and the quality, they are highly sought after and very competitive.

Haldeman felt that the political system in Canada had deteriorated with a rapid growth in the power of government to control the lives of individuals; he also perceived a drop in the moral standards of the country. This is a life write from the 90s from his fellow Canadian chiropractors. >During 1936-1941 J.N. Haldeman became involved with Technocracy, Inc., an international political group which ad-vocated economic reform through changes in the monetary system. His mother still pushes the health claims and only left South Africa right before the apartheid ended.

So thats why its a problem for WSE and not Tesla directly. And instead of actually doing that, their plan would be to disconnect Tesla sewages.

"*From Bloomberg News reporter Esha Dey:* Tesla shares are set to wipe out nearly one-fifth of their value in less than two weeks amid growing concerns that demand for electric cars is starting to weaken. The selloff started earlier this month when the electric-vehicle giant dialed back growth expectations during its third quarter earnings call. That was followed by grim commentary from several global automakers, as well as Wall Street analysts. This week, battery-maker Panasonic Holdings Corp. and chipmaker ON Semiconductor Corp. also sounded alarms for the EV industry. The warnings have weighed on stocks across the US automotive sector, which has also been battling extensive negotiations with its labor unions over wages. Still, Tesla’s decline stands out: shares have sunk around 20% since the Oct. 18 report, compared to a 3.6% drop in the S&P 500 Index, and a more than 4% decline in the Nasdaq 100. The retreat in the EV-maker’s stock price has erased about $145 billion from the company’s market capitalization.",30,0.65880746,0.327026,0.014166556,negative

Personally if Elon could have stayed far away from Twitter and spent his time and focus with the teams on these projects I think they would be farther along.

This article is pretty misleading. While it goes into a lot of detail about how cold can reduce range it fails to mention the most likely reason this fell short of its claimed range and why all other EVs will also: wind resistance at high speed. EVs have worse mileage at high speed than stop/start in the city. Estimated mileage is usually a mix of both. This “test” was almost completely at highway speeds. Although this is assuming the advertised range is a single number. If there are two and this is the highways range then the above doesn’t apply and Tesla are a bunch of lying scoundrels. Which they are anyway for other reasons. Edit: per ithinkstrangely’s comment below.

"Wow, it's actually much more dangerous than I expected. The front crumple zone is not properly engineered. The hit is so hard it shears a bolt (or something) in the rear suspension. That failure is probably rear steering, which to me indicates a pretty serious flaw. All the components of the tie-rod should be strong enough to hold the weight without the tie-rod or it's bolt snapping. Maybe someone forgot to tighten a nut or something, but I worry that it indicates a design shortcoming, or something more serious. A 286/65R20 tire weighs approximately 55 to 70lbs with an outer diameter of ~34.6"" while the 20"" wheel likely weighs 30-40lbs. The large outer dimensions of the wheel and tire during the high G-forces would have a lot of leverage over the steering components, which is why those components are usually overbuilt on heavy trucks. I am reminded of a Subaru SVX that I inherited when I was a kid. Subaru set out to design this revolutionary car, and they had all these awesome ideas that they tried to squeeze into a new package. Unfortunately, all those great ideas kept making the car heavier and heavier, while the transmission and brakes were borrowed from lightweight vehicles that came before. As a result, if you tried to stop from say, 100mph, the brakes would boil the fluid before you got down to 50mph. Very dangerous. And the transmission just lunched itself every 60,000 miles or so unless you were babying the car. A sports car. I still love the SVX, of course. But stories like these are crucial engineering lessons that Musk missed out on, because the narcissistic qualities it takes to say ""I will design a car from scratch better than companies that have been doing it for 100 years"" precluded him from learning and absorbing automotive engineering and manufacturing culture. That said, I never predicted that Tesla would make it this far with so many of their ambitious projects, and I have had to eat my hat once or twice.

Energy dissipation into other areas of the vehicle is often designed.

Also the hood as it should be designed didn't go into the compartment either and crumpled. So this does not necessarily mean a failure.

"My friend, If you get your car repaired, drive it to a external reviewer. It started with the steering rack issue, proberly the issue that should force Tesla to recall a few thousand cars. From there, two reasons. What you see on your car is a critical failure. On traveling speed, and if it did not announce itself before, could have lost control over the car and direction. Now two reasons I see for it. They managed to improper install the new steering rack or its ""whompy wheel(s)"". The steering issue is new one, and not every Tesla manufactured should/can have it. ""Just"" the last one to two years build? Chances are, the Service Center did a bad job. Either in installing it or by not checking if other parts of the steering - and with it the suspension - are damaged. Second possibility -> Whompy wheel(s). Whompy wheel has two causes. The used suspension(s) is not designed for a car that heavy and Tesla accepted parts that other brands would move into the rejects bin in QA. Tesla prefers to push the car out, as sold, not to hold it till QA is assured. So, what to do? At least check with a external reviewer if Musks is still OK to sacrifice you for his networth or get your money back. To be honest. If the car was... 10 years old, 100.000 miles? I would do the review thing and maybe report it to the right government agency. If a car is just 8 weeks old and got 2000 miles on the clock?

"Umm, that's not an ""alignment issue"" it's a broken/disconnected tie-rod issue.

But you’ve got 2 things going against you. 1) Newer cars aren’t as reliable as older cars these days. You’ve got new cars jammed with more tech (more possible failure points. I remember reading that reliability for most manufacturers dipped since leases were on the upward climb year over year) AND 2) this is during the time when Tesla is trying to reduce costs (removal of lumbar support for Model 3, removal of sensors, etc) and churn out as many cars as possible. “ I hear mostly good things from other owners” Probability.

It’s stainless steel, if you compromise the Chromium oxide layer in one spot, it will show some accumulation of rust on the surface. The solution is literally just wipe it off so a new chromium oxide layer can form. Think of the CO layer as a self healing clear coat. We all know you have to get bird shit or tree litter off your paint in a hurry or it can leave a dull spot on clear coat that will be visible in certain light gating conditions and at certain angles. That damage to the clear coat may be permanent and require a polish or other treatment to correct. Stainless steel is a lot tougher than painted mild steel or aluminum with a clear coat. But there are things that will cause surface oxidation, and when that happens, wash it. As soon as the clean steel is exposed to air it will form chromium oxide and will be rust proof again.",0,0.5806041,0.3957093,0.023686567,negative

They might think it’s clever marketing, but the misestimation of range also affects the Nav/charging planner as it believes the “rosy” estimate. With our Model S, we were driving in January upstate New York to pick up a puppy and the estimator told us to supercharge to X%, then drive to the next supercharger where we would arrive with 50 miles remaining and then top up again and continue. Wife smartly said “I don’t trust it, let’s charge an extra 50 miles range so we arrive with 100, who knows?” — we charged the extra 50 miles and got to the next supercharger with… 48 miles remaining.

The best I've ever gotten has been 260 miles of predicted range, with a weeks worth of driving at a max of 60mph and no AC use (it was cool enough I didn't need to use AC or heat), ideal temperature for the battery. I use the AC in the summer now, and depending on how hot the day is, I can use anywhere from 2% to 5% more battery on my 20 mile commute, than what it ""expected"".

The only way the range isn't accurate is if I don't enter a destination and start driving 70mph+. The facts about how EVs work is that range changes a lot depending on conditions and speed.

Set it to plaid and obviously that drops significantly.

"EPA tests aren't real. Tesla cars do fine in the city. The correct test for a Tesla is a highway range test, in various speeds and conditions. There have been Tesla range calculators for like 10 years now. This is not even a debate. Just test at 70mph in winter, and subtract 10% range for an old (5+ years) vehicle. Winter range will plummet even further, depending on traction (snow on the ground) and wind. There was a site called Teslike.com that had all the real ranges listed, and they were pretty good. But you're not going to hit 230wh/mile on the highway in winter. Bjorn Nyland did his first winter drives in Norway at 45kmh. My guess is that Tesla's aerodynamic advantages go away in the wind, and they have a smaller battery (82kwh Y) which is hit harder by the heater? Maybe all the cabin heat escapes through the glass roof..? It's still hard to believe it's THAT bad.
